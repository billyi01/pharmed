Inhibition of CDK4 and CDK6 leads to inhibition of cell proliferation and growth by blocking progression of cells from G1 to the S-phase of the cell cycle. Decreased expression of retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation (pRB) results in reduced E2F expression and signaling. Induces cell senescence. Mechanism_of_Resistance Acquired CDK6 amplification resulting in increased CDK6 expression. Increased expression of CDK2 and CDK4. Loss of pRb expression. Overexpression of cyclins A and E. Absorption Oral bioavailability is on the order of 46%. High-fat, high-calorie meal increases the AUC (area under the curve) of parent drug and its active metabolites by 9% and increases Cmax (maximum concentration) by 26%. Distribution Significant binding (96.3%) to plasma proteins, serum albumin, and alpha1-acid glycoprotein with extensive tissue distribution. Steady-state drug levels are achieved within 5 days following repeat daily dosing. Metabolism Extensively metabolized in the liver primarily by CYP3A4 microsomal enzymes, with formation of the major metabolite N-desethylabemaciclib (M2) and other additional metabolites, including M20, M18, and an oxidative metabolite (M1). These metabolites have similar biologic activity as the parent drug. Acylation and glucuronidation play only minor roles in drug metabolism. Nearly 81% of drug is recovered in feces and only 3% in urine, with the majority of eliminated drug being in metabolite form. The elimination half-life of the drug is 18.3 hours. Indication Approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer as initial endocrinebased therapy in postmenopausal women. FDA-approved in combination with fulvestrant for patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer in women with disease progression following endocrine therapy. FDA-approved as monotherapy for patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer in women with disease progression following endocrine therapy and prior chemotherapy in the metastatic setting. Dosage_Range Combination therapy with fulvestrant or an aromatase inhibitor - 150 mg PO bid. Monotherapy - 200 mg PO bid. Drug_Interaction Drugs that stimulate liver microsomal CYP3A4 enzymes, including phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifampin, phenobarbital, and St. John’s Wort - These drugs may increase the metabolism of abemaciclib, resulting in lower drug levels and potentially reduced clinical activity. Drugs that inhibit liver microsomal CYP3A4 enzymes, including ketoconazole, itraconazole, erythromycin, and clarithromycin - These drugs may reduce the metabolism of abemaciclib, resulting in increased drug levels and potentially increased toxicity. Special_Consideration Dose reduction is not required in the setting of mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B). Use with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment, and dose reduction is recommended. Dose reduction is not required in the setting of mild or moderate renal impairment. Has not been studied in the setting of severe renal impairment, end-stage renal disease, or in patients on dialysis. Closely monitor complete blood count (CBC) and platelet count every 2 weeks during the first 2 months of therapy and at monthly intervals thereafter. Closely monitor liver function tests (LFTs) at baseline and periodically while on therapy. LFTs should be monitored every 2 weeks for the first 2 months, monthly for the next 2 months, and then as clinically indicated. Monitor for signs and symptoms of infection. Monitor for signs and symptoms of venous thromboembolism. Pregnancy category D. Toxicity Myelosuppression with neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Fatigue, asthenia, and anorexia. Increased risk of infections, with upper respiratory infection being most common. Nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Increased risk of venous thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). Hepatotoxicity with elevated SGOT and SGPT. 1.2 Bevacizumab Trade_Name Avastin Classification antibody, anti-VEGF antibody Category Biologic response modifier agent Drug_Manufacturer Genentech/Roche Mechanism_of_Action Recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Binds to all isoforms of VEGF-A. VEGF is a pro-angiogenic growth factor that is overexpressed in a wide range of solid human cancers, including colorectal cancer. Precise mechanism(s) of action remain(s) unknown. Binding of VEGF prevents its subsequent interaction with VEGF receptors (VEGFR) on the surface of endothelial cells and tumors, and in so doing, results in inhibition of VEGFR-mediated signaling. Inhibits formation of new blood vessels in primary tumor and metastatic tumors. Inhibits tumor blood vessel permeability and reduces interstitial tumoral pressures, and in so doing, may enhance blood flow delivery within tumor. Restores antitumor response by enhancing dendritic cell function. Immunologic mechanisms may also be involved in antitumor activity, and they include recruitment of ADCC and/or complement-mediated cell lysis. Mechanism_of_Resistance Increased expression of pro-angiogenic factor ligands, such as PlGF, bFGF, and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Recruitment of bone marrow-derived cells, which circumvents the requirement of VEGF signaling and restores neovascularization and tumor angiogenesis. Increased pericyte coverage of the tumor vasculature, which serves to support its integrity and reduces the need for VEGF-mediated survival signaling. Activation and enhancement of invasion and metastasis to provide access to normal tissue vasculature without obligate neovascularization. Distribution Distribution in body is not well characterized. The predicted time to reach steady-state levels is on the order of 100 days. Metabosism Metabolism of bevacizumab has not been extensively characterized. Peripheral half-life is on the order of 17-21 days, with minimal clearance by the liver or kidneys. Tissue half-life has not been well characterized. Indication Metastatic colorectal cancer - FDA-approved for use in combination with any intravenous 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemotherapy in first-line therapy. Metastatic colorectal cancer - FDA-approved for use in the second-line setting in combination with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy after progression on first-line treatment that includes bevacizumab.

Ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer - FDA-approved in combination with paclitaxel, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, or topotecan for platinum-resistant recurrent disease. Ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer - FDA-approved in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel or carboplatin and gemcitabine, followed by bevacizumab as a single agent, for platinum-sensitive recurrent disease. Ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer - FDA-approved in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel followed by bevacizumab as a single agent for stage III or IV disease following initial surgical resection. Dosage_Range Recommended dose for the first-line treatment of advanced colorectal cancer is 5 mg/kg IV in combination with intravenous 5-FU-based chemotherapy on an every-2-week schedule. Recommended dose for the second-line treatment of advanced colorectal cancer in combination with FOLFOX-4 is 10 mg/kg IV on an every-2-week schedule. Can also be administered at 7.5 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks when used in combination with capecitabine-based regimens for advanced colorectal cancer. Recommended dose for advanced NSCLC is 15 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks with carboplatin/paclitaxel. Recommended dose for glioblastoma is 10 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks. Recommended dose for renal cell cancer is 10 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks with interferon-a. Recommended dose for cervical cancer is 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks with cisplatin/paclitaxel or paclitaxel/topotecan. Recommended dose for platinum-resistant ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer is 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks with paclitaxel, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, or weekly topotecan or 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks with topotecan given every 3 weeks. Recommended dose for platinum-sensitive ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer is 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks with carboplatin and paclitaxel for 6-8 cycles, followed by 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks as a single agent or 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks with carboplatin and gemcitabine for 6-10 cycles, followed by 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks as a single agent. Recommended dose for stage III or IV ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer following initial surgical resection is 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks with carboplatin and paclitaxel for up to 6 cycles, followed by 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks as a single agent for a total of up to 22 cycles. Drug_Interaction None well characterized to date. Special_Consideration Patients should be warned of the increased risk of arterial thromboembolic events, including myocardial infarction and stroke. Risk factors are age &lt;U+2265&gt;65 years and history of angina, stroke, and prior arterial thromboembolic events. This represents a black-box warning. Patients should be warned of the potential for serious and, in some cases, fatal hemorrhage resulting from hemoptysis in patients with NSCLC. These events have been mainly observed in patients with a central, cavitary, and/or necrotic lesion involving the pulmonary vasculature and have occurred suddenly. Patients with recent hemoptysis (&lt;U+2265&gt;1/2 tsp of red blood) should not receive bevacizumab. This represents a black-box warning. Bevacizumab treatment can result in the development of GI perforations, which in some cases has resulted in death. This event represents a blackbox warning for the drug. Use with caution in patients who have undergone recent surgical and/or invasive procedures. Bevacizumab should be given at least 28 days after any surgical and/or invasive intervention. Bevacizumab treatment can result in the development of wound dehiscence, which in some cases can be fatal. This represents a black-box warning. Use with caution in patients who have undergone recent surgical and/or invasive procedures. Bevacizumab should be given at least 28 days after any surgical and/or invasive intervention. Carefully monitor for infusion-related symptoms. May need to treat with diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and acetaminophen. Use with caution in patients with uncontrolled hypertension, as bevacizumab can result in grade 3 hypertension in about 10% of patients. Should be permanently discontinued in patients who develop hypertensive crisis. In most cases, however, hypertension is easily managed by increasing the dose of the antihypertensive medication and/or with the addition of another antihypertensive medication. Bevacizumab should be terminated in patients who develop the nephrotic syndrome. Therapy should be interrupted for proteinuria &lt;U+2265&gt;2 grams/24 hours and resumed when &lt;2 grams/24 hours. Bevacizumab treatment can result in reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS), as manifested by headache, seizure, lethargy, confusion, blindness and other visual side effects, as well as other neurologic disturbances. This syndrome can occur from 16 hours to 1 year after initiation of therapy and usually resolves or improves within days, and magnetic resonance imaging is necessary to confirm the diagnosis. There are no recommended dose reductions for bevacizumab. In the setting of adverse events, bevacizumab should be discontinued or temporarily interrupted. Pregnancy category B. Toxicity Gastrointestinal perforations and wound-healing complications. Bleeding complications, with epistaxis being most commonly observed. Serious, life-threatening pulmonary hemorrhage occurs in rare cases in patients with NSCLC, as outlined previously in Special Considerations. Increased risk of arterial thromboembolic events, including myocardial infarction, angina, and stroke. There is also an increased incidence of venous thromboembolic events. Hypertension occurs in 5%-18%. Usually well controlled with oral antihypertensive medication. Proteinuria with nephrotic syndrome &lt;1%. Infusion-related symptoms with fever, chills, urticaria, flushing, fatigue, headache, bronchospasm, dyspnea, angioedema, and hypotension. Infusion reactions occur in &lt;3% of patients, and severe reactions occur in 0.2% of patients. CNS events with dizziness and depression. RPLS occurs rarely (incidence of &lt;0.1%) and presents with headache, seizure, lethargy, confusion, blindness, and other visual disturbances. 1.3 Capecitabine Trade_Name Xeloda Classification Antimetabolite Category Chemotherapy drug Drug_Manufacturer Roche Mechanism_of_Action Fluoropyrimidine carbamate prodrug form of 5-FU. Capecitabine itself is inactive. Activation to cytotoxic forms is a complex process that involves three successive enzymatic steps. Metabolized in liver to 5’-deoxy-5-fluorocytidine (5’-DFCR) by the carboxylesterase enzyme and then to 5’-DFUR by cytidine deaminase (found in liver and in tumor tissues). Subsequently converted to 5-FU by the enzyme thymidine phosphorylase, which is expressed in higher levels in tumor versus normal tissue. Inhibition of the target enzyme thymidylate synthase (TS) by the 5-FU metabolite FdUMP. Incorporation of 5-FU metabolite FUTP into RNA, resulting in alterations in RNA processing and/or mRNA translation. Incorporation of 5-FU metabolite FdUTP into DNA, resulting in inhibition of DNA synthesis and function. Inhibition of TS leads to accumulation of dUMP and subsequent misincorporation of dUTP into DNA, resulting in inhibition of DNA synthesis and function. Mechanism_of_Resistance Increased expression of thymidylate synthase. Decreased levels of reduced folate substrate 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate. Decreased incorporation of 5-FU into RNA. Decreased incorporation of 5-FU into DNA. Increased activity of DNA repair enzymes, uracil glycosylase and dUTPase. Decreased expression of mismatch repair enzymes (hMLH1, hMSH2). Increased salvage of physiologic nucleosides, including thymidine. Increased expression of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase. Alterations in TS with decreased binding affinity of enzyme for FdUMP. Absorption Capecitabine is readily absorbed by the GI tract. Peak plasma levels are reached in 1.5 hours, while peak 5-FU levels are achieved at 2 hours after oral administration. The rate and extent of absorption are reduced by food. Distribution Plasma protein binding of capecitabine and its metabolites is less than 60%. Primarily bound to albumin (35%). Metabolism Capecitabine undergoes extensive enzymatic metabolism to 5-FU. After being absorbed as an intact molecule from the GI tract, it undergoes an initial hydrolysis reaction in the liver catalyzed by carboxylesterase to 5’-DFCR. In the next step, 5’-DFCR is converted in the liver and other tissues to 5’-DFUR by the enzyme cytidine deaminase. Finally, 5’-DFUR is converted to 5-FU by the enzyme thymidine phosphorylase in tumor tissue as well as in normal tissues expressing this enzyme. Selective accumulation of 5-FU within tumor tissue (colorectal) versus normal tissue (colon) (3.2 x) and plasma (21 x) has been demonstrated in a population of colorectal cancer patients requiring definitive surgical resection who received capecitabine preoperatively. Catabolism accounts for &gt;85% of drug metabolism. Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) is the main enzyme responsible for the catabolism of 5-FU, and it is present in liver and extrahepatic tissues such as GI mucosa, WBCs, and the kidneys. Greater than 90% of an administered dose of drug and its metabolites is cleared in the urine. The major metabolite excreted in urine is alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine (FBAL). About 3% of the administered dose is excreted in urine as unchanged drug. The elimination half-life of capecitabine and capecitabine metabolites is on the order of 45-60 minutes. Indication Metastatic breast cancer - FDA-approved when used in combination with docetaxel for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer after failure of prior anthracycline-containing chemotherapy. Metastatic breast cancer - FDA-approved as monotherapy in patients refractory to both paclitaxel- and anthracycline-based chemotherapy or when anthracycline therapy is contraindicated. Metastatic colorectal cancer - FDA-approved as first-line therapy when fluoropyrimidine therapy alone is preferred. Stage III colon cancer - FDA-approved as adjuvant therapy when fluoropyrimidine therapy alone is preferred. Clinical activity in gastric cancer, gastroesophageal cancer, and other GI cancers. Dosage_Range Recommended dose is 1,250 mg/m2 PO bid (morning and evening) for 2 weeks with 1 week rest. For combination therapy (capecitabine in combination with docetaxel) with docetaxel being dosed at 75 mg/m2 day 1 of a 21-day cycle. May decrease dose of capecitabine to 850-1,000 mg/m2 bid on days 1-14 to reduce risk of toxicity without compromising efficacy (see section Special Considerations [8]). An alternative dosing schedule for capecitabine monotherapy is 1,250-1,500 mg/m2 PO bid for 1 week on and 1 week off. This schedule appears to be well tolerated, with no compromise in clinical efficacy. Capecitabine should be used at lower doses (850-1,000 mg/m2 bid on days 1-14) when used in combination with other cytotoxic agents, such as oxaliplatin. Drug_Interaction Capecitabine-warfarin interaction - Patients receiving concomitant capecitabine and oral coumarin-derivative anticoagulant therapy should have their coagulation parameters (PT and INR) monitored frequently in order to adjust the anticoagulant dose accordingly. A clinically important capecitabine-warfarin drug interaction has been documented. Altered coagulation parameters and/or bleeding, including death, have been reported in patients taking capecitabine concomitantly with coumarin-derivative anticoagulants such as warfarin. Post-marketing reports have shown clinically significant increases in PT and INR in patients who were stabilized on anticoagulants at the time capecitabine was introduced. These events occurred within several days and up to several months after initiating capecitabine therapy and, in a few cases, within 1 month after stopping capecitabine. These events occurred in patients with and without liver metastases. Age &gt;60 and a diagnosis of cancer independently predispose patients to an increased risk of coagulopathy. Aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide - Concomitant use of aluminum hydroxide- or magnesium hydroxide-containing antacids may increase the bioavailability of capecitabine by 16%-35%. Phenytoin - Capecitabine may increase phenytoin blood levels and subsequent phenytoin toxicity. Dose adjustment of phenytoin may be necessary. Leucovorin - Leucovorin enhances the antitumor activity and toxicity of capecitabine. Special_Consideration Capecitabine should be taken with a glass of water within 30 minutes after a meal. Contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to 5-FU. Contraindicated in patients with known dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency. No dose adjustments are necessary in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction. However, patients should be closely monitored. In the setting of moderate renal dysfunction (baseline CrCl, 30-50 mL/min), a 25% dose reduction is recommended. Patients should be closely monitored, as they may be at greater risk for increased toxicity. Contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl &lt;30 mL/min). Patients should be monitored for diarrhea and its associated sequelae, including dehydration, fluid imbalance, and infection. Elderly patients (&gt;80 years of age) are especially vulnerable to the GI toxicity of capecitabine. Moderate-to-severe diarrhea (&gt;grade 2) is an indication to interrupt therapy immediately. Subsequent doses should be reduced accordingly. Drug therapy should be stopped immediately in the presence of grades 2 to 4 hyperbilirubinemia until complete resolution or a decrease in intensity to grade 1. Drug therapy should be stopped immediately in the presence of grade 2 or higher adverse events until complete resolution or a decrease in intensity to grade 1. Treatment should continue at 75% of the initial starting dose for grade 2 or 3 toxicity. For grade 4 toxicities, if the physician chooses to continue treatment, treatment should continue at 50% of the initial starting dose. Patients who experience unexpected, severe grade 3 or 4 myelosuppression, GI toxicity, and/or neurologic toxicity upon initiation of therapy may have an underlying deficiency in dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase. Therapy must be discontinued immediately, and further testing to identify the presence of this pharmacogenetic syndrome should be considered. Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine, 50 mg PO bid) may be used to prevent and/or reduce the incidence and severity of hand-foot syndrome. Dose may be increased to 100 mg PO bid if symptoms do not resolve within 3-4 days. Celecoxib at a dose of 200 mg PO bid may be effective in preventing and/or reducing the incidence and severity of hand-foot syndrome. A low-dose nicotine patch has also been found to be effective in this setting. In patients with the hand-foot syndrome, the affected skin should be well hydrated using a bland and mild moisturizer. Instruct patients to soak affected hands and feet in cool to tepid water for 10 minutes, then apply petroleum jelly onto the wet skin. The use of lanolin-containing salves or ointments such as Bag Balm emollient may help. Diltiazem can prevent capecitabine-induced coronary vasospasm and chest pain and may allow patients to continue to receive capecitabine. Pregnancy category D. Breastfeeding should be avoided. Toxicity Diarrhea is dose-limiting, observed in up to 55% of patients. Similar to GI toxicity observed with continuous infusion 5-FU. Mucositis, loss of appetite, and dehydration also noted. Hand-foot syndrome (palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia). Severe hand-foot syndrome is seen in 15%-20% of patients. Characterized by tingling, numbness, pain, erythema, dryness, rash, swelling, increased pigmentation, and/or pruritus of the hands and feet. Similar to dermatologic toxicity observed with continuous infusion 5-FU. Nausea and vomiting occur in up to 50% of patients. Elevations in serum bilirubin (20%-40%), alkaline phosphatase, and hepatic transaminases (SGOT, SGPT). Usually transient and clinically asymptomatic. Myelosuppression is observed less frequently than with IV 5-FU. Leukopenia more common than thrombocytopenia. Neurologic toxicity manifested by confusion, cerebellar ataxia, and rarely encephalopathy. Cardiac symptoms of chest pain, ECG changes, and serum enzyme elevation. Rare event but increased risk in patients with prior history of ischemic heart disease. Tear-duct stenosis, acute and chronic conjunctivitis. 1.4 Carboplatin Trade_Name Paraplatin CBDCA Classification Platinum analog Category Chemotherapy drug Drug_Manufacturer Bristol-Myers Squibb Mechanism_of_Action Covalently binds to DNA with preferential binding to the N-7 position of guanine and adenine. Reacts with two different sites on DNA to produce cross-links, either intrastrand (&gt;90%) or interstrand (&lt;5%). Formation of DNA adducts results in inhibition of DNA synthesis and function as well as inhibition of transcription. Binding to nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins may result in cytotoxic effects. Cell cycle - nonspecific agent. Mechanism_of_Resistance Reduced accumulation of carboplatin due to alterations in cellular transport. Increased inactivation by thiol-containing proteins such as glutathione and glutathione-related enzymes. Enhanced DNA repair enzyme activity (e.g., ERCC-1). Deficiency in mismatch repair (MMR) enzymes (e.g., hMLH1, hMSH2). Absorption Administered only via the IV route. Distribution Widely distributed in body tissues. Crosses the blood-brain barrier and enters the CSF. Does not bind to plasma proteins and has an apparent volume of distribution of 16 L. Metabolism Carboplatin does not undergo significant metabolism. As observed with cisplatin, carboplatin undergoes aquation reaction in the presence of low concentrations of chloride. This reaction is 100-fold slower with carboplatin when compared to cisplatin. Carboplatin is extensively cleared by the kidneys, with about 60% - 70% of drug excreted in urine within 24 hours. The elimination of carboplatin is slower than that of cisplatin, with a terminal half-life of 2 - 6 hours. Indication Ovarian cancer. Germ cell tumors. Head and neck cancer. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and NSCLC. Bladder cancer. Relapsed and refractory acute leukemia. Endometrial cancer. Dosage_Range Dose of carboplatin is usually calculated to a target area under the curve (AUC) based on the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Calvert formula is used to calculate dose - Total dose (mg) = (target AUC) x (GFR + 25). Note: Dose is in mg NOT mg/m2. Target AUC is usually between 5 and 7 mg/mL/min for previously untreated patients. In previously treated patients, lower AUCs (between 4 and 6 mg/mL/min) are recommended. AUCs &gt;7 are not associated with improved response rates. Bone marrow/stem cell transplant setting - Doses up to 1600 mg/m2 divided over several days. Drug_Interaction Myelosuppressive agents - Increased risk of myelosuppression when carboplatin is combined with other myelosuppressive drugs. Paclitaxel - Carboplatin should be administered after paclitaxel when carboplatin and paclitaxel are used in combination. This sequence prevents delayed paclitaxel excretion, which results in increased paclitaxel drug levels and potentially increased host toxicity. Special_Consideration Use with caution in patients with abnormal renal function. Dose reduction is required in the setting of renal dysfunction. Baseline CrCl must be obtained. Renal status must be closely monitored during therapy. Although carboplatin is not as emetogenic as cisplatin, pretreatment with antiemetic agents is strongly recommended. Avoid needles or IV administration sets containing aluminum because precipitation of drug may occur. Contraindicated in patients with a history of severe allergic reactions to cisplatin, other platinum compounds, and mannitol. In contrast to cisplatin, IV hydration pretreatment and post-treatment are not necessary. However, patients should still be instructed to maintain adequate oral hydration. Hemodialysis clears carboplatin at 25% of the rate of renal clearance. Peritoneal dialysis is unable to remove carboplatin. Risk of hypersensitivity reactions increases from 1% to 27% in patients receiving more than seven courses of carboplatin-based therapy. For such patients, a 0.02-mL intradermal injection of an undiluted aliquot of their planned carboplatin dose can be administered 1 hour before each cycle of carboplatin. This skin test identifies patients in whom carboplatin may be safely administered. Pregnancy category D. Breastfeeding should be avoided. Toxicity Myelosuppression is significant and dose-limiting. Dose-dependent, cumulative toxicity is more severe in elderly patients. Thrombocytopenia is most commonly observed, with nadir by day 21. Nausea and vomiting. Delayed nausea and vomiting can also occur, albeit rarely. Significantly less emetogenic than cisplatin. Renal toxicity. Significantly less common than with cisplatin and rarely symptomatic. Peripheral neuropathy is observed in less than 10% of patients. Patients older than 65 years and/or previously treated with cisplatin may be at higher risk for developing neurologic toxicity. Mild and reversible elevation of liver enzymes, particularly alkaline phosphatase and SGOT. Allergic reaction. Can occur within a few minutes of starting therapy. Presents mainly as skin rash, urticaria, and pruritus. Bronchospasm and hypotension are uncommon. Alopecia is uncommon. 1.5 Cetuximab Trade_Name Erbitux Classification Monoclonal antibody, anti-EGFR antibody Category Biologic response modifier agent, targeted agent Drug_Manufacturer Bristol-Myers Squibb and ImClone/Eli Lilly Mechanism_of_Action Recombinant chimeric IgG1 monoclonal antibody directed against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). EGFR is overexpressed in a broad range of human solid tumors, including colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer, NSCLC, pancreatic cancer, and breast cancer. Precise mechanism(s) of action remain(s) unknown. Binds with nearly 10-fold higher affinity to EGFR than normal ligands EGF and TGF-a, which then results in inhibition of EGFR. Prevents both homodimerization and heterodimerization of the EGFR, which leads to inhibition of autophosphorylation and inhibition of EGFR signaling. Inhibition of the EGFR signaling pathway results in inhibition of critical mitogenic and anti-apoptotic signals involved in proliferation, growth, invasion/metastasis, and angiogenesis. Inhibition of the EGFR pathway enhances the response to chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. Immunologic mechanisms may also be involved in antitumor activity, and they include recruitment of ADCC and/or complement-mediated cell lysis. Mechanism_of_Resistance Mutations in EGFR, leading to decreased binding affinity to cetuximab. Decreased expression of EGFR. Increased expression of TGF-alpha ligand. Presence of KRAS mutations, which mainly occur in codons 12 and 13. Presence of BRAF mutations. Presence of NRAS mutations. Increased expression of HER2 through gene amplification. Increased HER3 expression. Activation/induction of alternative cellular signaling pathways, such as PI3K/Akt and IGF-1R. Increased expression of lncRNA MIR100HG and two embedded miRNAs, miR-100 and miR-125, that then leads to activation of Wnt signaling. Distribution Distribution in the body is not well characterized. Metabolism Metabolism of cetuximab has not been extensively characterized. Half-life is on the order of 5-7 days. Indication FDA-approved for the treatment of EGFR-expressing mCRC in combination with irinotecan in irinotecan-refractory disease or as monotherapy in patients who are deemed to be irinotecan-intolerant. The use of cetuximab is not recommended for the treatment of mCRC with RAS mutations. Approved in Europe in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy in the front-line treatment of wild-type RAS mCRC. FDA-approved in combination with FOLFIRI in the front-line treatment of wild-type RAS mCRC. Head and neck cancer - FDA-approved for use in combination with radiation therapy for the treatment of locally or regionally advanced squamous cell cancer of the head and neck. Head and neck cancer - FDA-approved for use in combination with platinumbased therapy with 5-FU for the treatment of recurrent locoregional disease or metastatic squamous cell cancer of the head and neck. Head and neck cancer - FDA-approved as monotherapy for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic squamous cell cancer of the head and neck progressing after platinum-based therapy. Dosage_Range Loading dose of 400 mg/m2 IV administered over 120 minutes, followed by maintenance dose of 250 mg/m2 IV given on a weekly basis. An alternative dosing schedule is 500 mg/m2 IV every 2 weeks, with no need for a loading dose. Drug_interaction None well characterized to date. Special_Consideration Cetuximab should be used with caution in patients with known hypersensitivity to murine proteins and/or any individual components. The level of EGFR expression does not accurately predict cetuximab clinical activity. As such, EGFR testing should not be required for the clinical use of cetuximab. Extended KRAS and NRAS testing should be performed in all patients being considered for cetuximab therapy. Only patients with wildtype KRAS and NRAS should be treated with cetuximab, either as monotherapy or in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy. Development of skin toxicity appears to be a surrogate marker for cetuximab clinical activity. Use with caution in patients with underlying ILD, as these patients are at increased risk for developing worsening of their ILD. In patients who develop a skin rash, topical antibiotics such as clindamycin gel or erythromycin cream or either oral clindamycin, oral doxycycline, or oral minocycline may help. Patients should be warned to avoid sunlight exposure. About 90% of patients experience severe infusion reactions with the first infusion despite the use of prophylactic antihistamine therapy. However, some patients may experience infusion reactions with later infusions. Electrolyte status should be closely monitored, especially serum magnesium levels, as hypomagnesemia has been observed with cetuximab treatment. Pregnancy category C. Breastfeeding should be avoided. Toxicity Infusion-related symptoms with fever, chills, urticaria, flushing, fatigue, headache, bronchospasm, dyspnea, angioedema, and hypotension. Occurs in 40%-50% of patients, although severe reactions occur in less than 1%. Usually mild-to-moderate severity and observed most commonly with administration of the first infusion. Pruritus, dry skin with mainly a pustular, acneiform skin rash. Presents mainly on the face, neck region, and upper trunk. Improves with continued treatment and resolves upon cessation of therapy. Pulmonary toxicity in the form of ILD manifested by increased cough, dyspnea, and pulmonary infiltrates. Observed in less than 1% of patients and more frequent in patients with underlying pulmonary disease. Hypomagnesemia. Asthenia and generalized malaise observed in nearly 50% of patients. Paronychial inflammation with swelling of the lateral nail folds of the toes and fingers. Occurs with prolonged use. 1.6 5-Fluorouracil Trade_Name 5-FU Efudex Classification Antimetabolite Category Chemotherapy drug Drug_Manufacturer Roche Mechanism_of_Action Fluoropyrimidine analog. Cell cycle-specific with activity in the S-phase. Requires activation to cytotoxic metabolite forms. Inhibition of the target enzyme thymidylate synthase (TS) by the 5-FU metabolite, FdUMP. Incorporation of the 5-FU metabolite FUTP into RNA, resulting in alterations in RNA processing and/or mRNA translation. Incorporation of the 5-FU metabolite FdUTP into DNA, resulting in inhibition of DNA synthesis and function. Inhibition of TS leads to accumulation of dUMP, which then gets misincorporated into DNA in the form of dUTP, resulting in inhibition of DNA synthesis and function. Mechanism_of_Resistance Increased expression of thymidylate synthase (TS). Decreased levels of reduced folate substrate 5, 10-methylenetetrahydrofolate for TS reaction. Decreased incorporation of 5-FU into RNA. Decreased incorporation of 5-FU into DNA. Increased activity of DNA repair enzymes, uracil glycosylase and dUTPase. Increased salvage of physiologic nucleosides, including thymidine. Increased expression of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD). Decreased expression of mismatch repair enzymes (hMLH1, hMSH2). Alterations in TS, with decreased binding affinity of enzyme for FdUMP. Absorption Administered only via the IV route, as oral absorption is variable and erratic. Distribution After IV administration, 5-FU is widely distributed to tissues, with highest concentration in GI mucosa, bone marrow, and liver. Penetrates into third-space fluid collections such as ascites and pleural effusions. Crosses the blood-brain barrier and distributes into CSF and brain tissue. Binding to plasma proteins has not been well characterized. Metabolism Undergoes extensive enzymatic metabolism intracellularly to cytotoxic metabolites. Catabolism accounts for &gt;85% of drug metabolism. DPD is the main enzyme responsible for 5-FU catabolism, and it is highly expressed in liver and extrahepatic tissues such as GI mucosa, WBCs, and kidney. Greater than 90% of an administered dose of drug is cleared in urine and lungs. The terminal elimination half-life is short, ranging from 10 to 20 min. Indication Colorectal cancer - Adjuvant setting and advanced disease. Breast cancer - Adjuvant setting and advanced disease. GI malignancies, including anal, esophageal, gastric, and pancreatic cancer. Head and neck cancer. Hepatoma. Ovarian cancer. Topical use in basal cell cancer of skin and actinic keratoses. Dosage_Range Bolus monthly schedule: 425-450 mg/m2 IV on days 1-5 every 28 days. Bolus weekly schedule: 500-600 mg/m2 IV every week for 6 weeks every 8 weeks. 24-hour infusion: 2400-2600 mg/m2 IV every week. 96-hour infusion: 800-1000 mg/m2/day IV. 120-hour infusion: 1000 mg/m2/day IV on days 1-5 every 21-28 days. Protracted continuous infusion: 200-400 mg/m2/day IV. Drug_Interaction Leucovorin - Leucovorin enhances the antitumor activity and toxicity of 5-FU. Stabilizes the TS-FdUMP-reduced folate ternary complex, resulting in maximal inhibition of TS. Methotrexate, trimetrexate - Antifolate analogs increase the formation of 5-FU nucleotide metabolites when given 24 hours before 5-FU. Thymidine - Rescues against the TS- and DNA-mediated toxic effects of 5-FU. Vistonuridine (uridine triacetate) - Rescues against the toxic effects of 5-FU. Special_Consideration No dose adjustments are necessary in patients with mild to moderate liver or renal dysfunction. However, patients should be closely monitored, as they may be at increased risk for toxicity. Contraindicated in patients with bone marrow depression, poor nutritional status, infection, active ischemic heart disease, or history of myocardial infarction within previous 6 months. Patients should be monitored closely for mucositis and/or diarrhea, as there is increased potential for dehydration, fluid imbalance, and infection. Elderly patients are at especially high risk for GI toxicity. Patients who experience unexpected, severe grade 3 or 4 myelosuppression, GI toxicity, and/or neurologic toxicity with initiation of therapy may have an underlying deficiency in DPD. Therapy must be discontinued immediately. Further testing to identify the presence of this pharmacogenetic syndrome (autosomal recessive) should be considered. Vistonuridine, at a dose of 10 g PO every 6 hours, may be used in patients overdosed with 5-FU or in those who experience severe toxicity. Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine 50 mg PO bid), celecoxib (200 mg PO bid), and nicotine patch may be used to prevent and/or reduce the incidence and severity of hand-foot syndrome. Use of ice chips in mouth 10-15 minutes pre- and 10-15 minutes post-IV bolus injections of 5-FU may reduce the incidence and severity of mucositis. Pregnancy category D. Breastfeeding should be avoided. Toxicity Myelosuppression. Dose-limiting for the qd x 5 or weekly schedules, less frequently observed with infusional therapy. Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia more common than anemia. Mucositis and/or diarrhea. May be severe and dose-limiting for infusional schedules. Nausea and vomiting are mild and rare. Hand-foot syndrome (palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia). Characterized by tingling, numbness, pain, erythema, dryness, rash, swelling, increased pigmentation, nail changes, pruritus of the hands and feet, and/or desquamation. Most often observed with infusional therapy and can be dose-limiting. Neurologic toxicity manifested by somnolence, confusion, seizures, cerebellar ataxia, and rarely encephalopathy. Cardiac symptoms of chest pain, ECG changes, and serum enzyme elevation. Rare event but increased risk in patients with prior history of ischemic heart disease. Blepharitis, tear-duct stenosis, acute and chronic conjunctivitis. Dry skin, photosensitivity, and pigmentation of the infused vein are common. Metallic taste in mouth during IV bolus injection. 1.7 Ipilimumab Trade_Name Yervoy Classification Monoclonal antibody, immune checkpoint inhibitor Category Immunotherapy Drug_Manufacturer Bristol-Myers Squibb Mechanism_of_Action Ipilimumab binds to cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), which is expressed on the surface of activated CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes, resulting in inhibition of the interaction between CTLA-4 and its target ligands CD80/CD86. Blockade of CTLA-4 enhances T-cell immune responses, including T-cell activation and proliferation. Mechanism_of_Resistance Increased expression and/or activity of other immune checkpoint pathways (e.g., TIGIT, TIM3, and LAG3). Increased expression of other immune escape mechanisms. Increased infiltration of immune suppressive populations within the tumor microenvironment, which include Tregs, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and M2 macrophages. Release of various cytokines, chemokines, and metabolites within the tumor microenvironment, including CSF-1, tryptophan metabolites, TGF-beta, and adenosine.

Advanced renal cell cancer: Recommended dose is 1 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks for a maximum of 4 doses. Drug_Interaction None characterized to date. Special_Consideration Ipilimumab can result in severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions due to T-cell activation and proliferation. These immune-mediated reactions may involve any organ system, with the most common reactions being enterocolitis, hepatitis, dermatitis, neuropathy, and endocrinopathy. They typically occur during treatment, although some of these reactions may occur weeks to months after completion of therapy. These reactions represent a black-box warning. Ipilimumab should be permanently discontinued for any of the following: Persistent moderate adverse reactions or inability to reduce daily steroid dose to 7.5 mg prednisone Failure to complete the full treatment course within 16 weeks from administration of first dose Colitis with abdominal pain, fever, ileus, or peritoneal signs; increase in stool frequency with 7 or more over baseline; stool incontinence; need for IV hydration for more than 24 hours; GI hemorrhage; and GI perforation SGOT/SGPT &gt;5 x ULN or total bilirubin &gt;3 x ULN Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, or rash complicated by full-thickness dermal ulceration or necrotic, bullous, or hemorrhagic manifestations Severe motor or sensory neuropathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome, or myasthenia gravis Severe immune-mediated reactions involving any organ system Immune-mediated ocular disease that is unresponsive to topical immunosuppressive therapy Ipilimumab should be withheld for any moderate immune-mediated adverse reaction or for symptomatic endocrinopathy. For patients with partial or complete resolution of symptoms (grade 0-1) and who are receiving less than 7.5 mg prednisone, ipilimumab may be resumed at a dose of 3 mg/kg every 3 weeks until administration of all four planned doses or 16 weeks from first dose, whichever occurs earlier. Closely monitor for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis, such as diarrhea and abdominal pain. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease may not be appropriate candidates for ipilimumab. In patients with moderate enterocolitis, withhold ipilimumab therapy and administer antidiarrheal treatment. If symptoms persist for more than 1 week, administer prednisone at 0.5 mg/kg. In patients with severe enterocolitis, permanently discontinue ipilimumab and administer prednisone at 1-2 mg/kg/day. Administer steroid eye drops to patients who develop uveitis, iritis, or episcleritis. Permanently discontinue ipilimumab for immune-mediated ocular disease that is unresponsive to local immunosuppressive therapy. In this setting, administer prednisone at 1-2 mg/kg/day. FDA-approved Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program has been developed to inform healthcare providers about the risk of serious immune-mediated adverse reactions caused by ipilimumab. Monitor thyroid function tests at the start of treatment and before each dose. Pregnancy category C. Breastfeeding should be avoided. Toxicity Fatigue and anorexia. Immune-mediated enterocolitis presenting as diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, and ileus. Immune-mediated hepatitis that can range from moderate to severe life-threatening hepatotoxicity.

Hypothyroidism. 1.9 Oxaliplatin Trade_Name Eloxatin Diaminocyclohexane platinum Classification Platinum analog Category Chemotherapy drug Drug_Manufacturer Sanofi-Aventis Mechanism_of_Action Third-generation platinum compound. Cell cycle - nonspecific, with activity in all phases of the cell cycle. Covalently binds to DNA, with preferential binding to the N-7 position of guanine and adenine. Reacts with two different sites on DNA to produce cross-links, either intrastrand (&lt;90%) or interstrand (&lt;5%). Formation of DNA adducts results in inhibition of DNA synthesis and function as well as inhibition of transcription. DNA mismatch repair enzymes are unable to recognize oxaliplatin-DNA adducts in contrast with other platinum-DNA adducts as a result of their bulkier size. Binding to nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins may result in additional cytotoxic effects. Mechanism_of_Resistance Decreased drug accumulation due to alterations in cellular transport. Increased inactivation by thiol-containing proteins such as glutathione and glutathione-related enzymes. Increased DNA repair enzyme activity (e.g., ERCC-1). Non - cross-resistant to cisplatin and carboplatin in tumor cells that are deficient in MMR enzymes (e.g., hMHL1, hMSH2). Absorption Administered only via the IV route, as it is not orally bioavailable. Distribution Widely distributed to all tissues, with a 50-fold higher volume of distribution than cisplatin. About 40% of drug is sequestered in red blood cells within 2-5 hours of infusion. Extensively binds to plasma proteins in time-dependent manner (up to 98%). Metabolism Undergoes extensive non-enzymatic conversion to its active cytotoxic species. As observed with cisplatin, oxaliplatin undergoes aquation reaction in the presence of low concentrations of chloride. The major species are monochloro-DACH, dichloro-DACH, and mono-diaquo-DACH platinum. Renal excretion accounts for &gt;50% of oxaliplatin clearance. More than 20 different metabolites have been identified in the urine. Only 2% of drug is excreted in feces. Prolonged terminal half-life of up to 240 hours. Indication Metastatic colorectal cancer - FDA-approved in combination with infusional 5-FU/LV in patients with advanced, metastatic disease. Early-stage colon cancer - FDA-approved as adjuvant therapy in combination with infusional 5-FU/LV in patients with stage III colon cancer and also effective in patients with high-risk stage II disease. Metastatic pancreatic cancer. Metastatic gastric cancer and gastroesophageal cancer. Dosage_Range Recommended dose is 85 mg/m2 IV over 2 hours, on an every-2-week schedule. Can also be administered at 100-130 mg/m2 IV on an every-3-week schedule. Drug_Interaction None well characterized. Special_Consideration Use with caution in patients with abnormal renal function, especially when CrCl &lt;20 mL/min. Baseline creatinine clearance should be obtained, and renal status should be closely monitored during treatment. Oxaliplatin should not be administered with basic solutions (e.g., solutions containing 5-FU), as it may be partially degraded. Careful neurologic evaluation should be performed before starting therapy and at the beginning of each cycle, as the dose-limiting toxicity of oxaliplatin is neurotoxicity. Caution patients to avoid exposure to cold following drug administration, which can trigger and/or worsen acute neurotoxicity. Calcium/magnesium infusions (1 g calcium gluconate/1 g magnesium sulfate) prior to and at the completion of the oxaliplatin infusion can be used to reduce the incidence of acute neurotoxicity. There is no evidence that these infusions impair the clinical activity of oxaliplatin. May lengthen oxaliplatin infusion from 2 to up to 4 hours to reduce the development of acute neurotoxicity. Anaphylactic reactions to oxaliplatin have been reported and may occur within minutes of drug administration. This adverse event represents a black-box warning. Pregnancy category D. Breastfeeding should be avoided. Toxicity Neurotoxicity with acute and chronic forms. Acute toxicity is seen in up to 80%-85% of patients and is characterized by a peripheral sensory neuropathy with distal paresthesia and visual and voice changes, often triggered or exacerbated by cold. Dysesthesias in the upper extremities and laryngopharyngeal region with episodes of difficulty breathing or swallowing can be observed and usually within hours or 1-3 days after therapy. Risk increases upon exposure to cold and usually is spontaneously reversible. Chronic toxicity is dose-dependent, with a 15% and &gt;50% risk of impairment in proprioception and neurosensory function at cumulative doses of 850 and 1,200 mg/m2, respectively. In contrast to cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity, oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy appears to be more readily reversible and returns to normal usually within 3-4 months of discontinuation of oxaliplatin. Gait abnormalities and cognitive dysfunction can also occur. Nausea/vomiting. Occurs in the majority of patients treated with the combination of 5-FU/LV and oxaliplatin. Usually well-controlled with antiemetic therapy. Diarrhea. Myelosuppression. Relatively mild, with thrombocytopenia and anemia more common than neutropenia. Autoimmune thrombocytopenia, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and TTP have also been observed, albeit rarely. Allergic reactions with facial flushing, rash, urticaria, and less frequently, bronchospasm and hypotension. In rare cases, anaphylactic-like reactions can occur. Hepatotoxicity with sinusoidal injury resulting in portal hypertension, ascites, splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, and varices. RPLS has been observed with headache, lethargy, seizures, visual disturbances, and encephalopathy. Rare cases of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), acute ILD, and pulmonary fibrosis. 1.10 Paclitaxel Trade_Name Taxol Classification Taxane, antimicrotubule agent Category Chemotherapy drug Drug_Manufacturer Bristol-Myers Squibb Mechanism_of_Action Isolated from the bark of the Pacific yew tree, Taxus brevifolia. Cell cycle-specific, active in the mitosis (M) phase of the cell cycle. High-affinity binding to microtubules enhances tubulin polymerization. Normal dynamic process of microtubule network is inhibited, leading to inhibition of mitosis and cell division. Mechanism_of_Resistance Alterations in tubulin, with decreased binding affinity for drug. Multidrug-resistant phenotype, with increased expression of P170 glycoprotein. Results in enhanced drug efflux, with decreased intracellular accumulation of drug. Cross-resistant to other natural products, including vinca alkaloids, anthracyclines, taxanes, and etoposide. Absorption Administered only via the IV route, as the drug is poorly soluble and not orally bioavailable. Distribution Distributes widely to all body tissues, including third-space fluid collections such as ascites. Negligible penetration into the CNS. Extensive binding (&gt;90%) to plasma and cellular proteins. Metabolism Metabolized extensively by the hepatic P450 microsomal system. About 70%-80% of drug is excreted via fecal elimination. Less than 10% is eliminated as the parent form, with the majority being eliminated as metabolites. Renal clearance is relatively minor, with less than 10% of drug cleared via the kidneys. Terminal elimination half-life ranges from 9 to 50 hours depending on the schedule of administration. Indication Ovarian cancer. Breast cancer. SCLC and NSCLC. Head and neck cancer. Esophageal cancer. Prostate cancer. Bladder cancer. AIDS-related Kaposi’s sarcoma. Dosage_Range Ovarian cancer: 135-175 mg/m2 IV as a 3-hour infusion every 3 weeks. Breast cancer: 175 mg/m2 IV as a 3-hour infusion every 3 weeks. Bladder cancer, head and neck cancer: 250 mg/m2 IV as a 24-hour infusion every 3 weeks. Weekly schedule: 80-100 mg/m2 IV each week for 3 weeks with 1-week rest. Infusional schedule: 140 mg/m2 as a 96-hour infusion. Drug_Interaction Radiation therapy - Paclitaxel is a radiosensitizing agent. Concomitant use of inhibitors and/or activators of the liver P450 CYP3A4 enzyme system may affect paclitaxel metabolism and its subsequent antitumor and toxic effects. Phenytoin, phenobarbital - Accelerate the metabolism of paclitaxel, resulting in lower plasma levels of drug. Cisplatin, carboplatin - Myelosuppression is greater when platinum compound is administered before paclitaxel. Platinum compounds inhibit plasma clearance of paclitaxel. When a platinum analog is used in combination, paclitaxel must be given first. Cyclophosphamide - Myelosuppression is greater when cyclophosphamide is administered before paclitaxel. Doxorubicin - Paclitaxel reduces the plasma clearance of doxorubicin by about 30%, resulting in increased severity of myelosuppression. Special_Consideration Contraindicated in patients with history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to paclitaxel or to other drugs formulated in Cremophor EL, including cyclosporine, etoposide, or teniposide. Use with caution in patients with abnormal liver function. Dose reduction is required in this setting. Patients with abnormal liver function are at significantly higher risk for toxicity. Contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction. Use with caution in patients with prior history of diabetes mellitus and chronic alcoholism or prior therapy with known neurotoxic agents such as cisplatin. Use with caution in patients with previous history of ischemic heart disease, with MI within the preceding 6 months, conduction system abnormalities, or on medications known to alter cardiac conduction (beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digoxin). Patients should receive premedication to prevent the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions. Administer dexamethasone 20 mg PO at 12 and 6 hours before drug administration, diphenhydramine 50 mg IV, and cimetidine 300 mg IV at 30 minutes before drug administration. Patients experiencing major hypersensitivity reaction may be rechallenged after receiving multiple high doses of steroids, dexamethasone 20 mg IV every 6 hours for 4 doses. Patients should also be treated with diphenhydramine 50 mg IV and cimetidine 300 mg IV 30 minutes before the rechallenge. Medical personnel should be readily available at the time of drug administration. Emergency equipment, including Ambu bag, ECG machine, IV fluids, pressors, and other drugs for resuscitation, must be at bedside before initiation of treatment. Monitor patient’s vital signs every 15 minutes during the first hour of drug administration. Hypersensitivity reaction usually occurs within 2 - 3 minutes of start of infusion and almost always within the first 10 minutes. Patients who have received &gt;6 courses of weekly paclitaxel should be advised to avoid sun exposure of their skin as well as their fingernails and toenails, as they are at increased risk for developing onycholysis. This side effect is not observed with the every-3-week schedule. Pregnancy category D. Breastfeeding should be avoided. Toxicity Myelosuppression. Dose-limiting neutropenia with nadir at day 8-10 and recovery by day 15-21. Decreased incidence of neutropenia with 3-hour schedule when compared to 24-hour schedule. Infusion reactions. Occurs in up to 20%-40% of patients. Characterized by generalized skin rash, flushing, erythema, hypotension, dyspnea, and/or bronchospasm. Usually occurs within the first 2-3 minutes of an infusion and almost always within the first 10 minutes. Incidence of hypersensitivity reaction is the same with 3- and 24-hour schedules. Premedication regimen, as outlined in Special Considerations, has significantly decreased incidence. Neurotoxicity, mainly in the form of sensory neuropathy with numbness and paresthesias. Dose-dependent effect. Other risk factors include prior exposure to known neurotoxic agents (e.g., cisplatin) and pre-existing medical disorders such as diabetes mellitus and chronic alcoholism. More frequent with longer infusions and at doses &gt;175 mg/m2. Motor and autonomic neuropathy observed at high doses. Optic nerve disturbances with scintillating scotomata observed rarely. Transient asymptomatic sinus bradycardia is most commonly observed cardiotoxicity. Occurs in 30% of patients. Other rhythm disturbances are seen, including Mobitz type I, Mobitz type II, and third-degree heart block, as well as ventricular arrhythmias. Alopecia. Occurs in nearly all patients, with loss of total body hair. Mucositis and/or diarrhea seen in 30%-40% of patients. Mucositis is more common with the 24-hour schedule. Mild-to-moderate nausea and vomiting, usually of brief duration. Transient elevations in serum transaminases, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase. Onycholysis. Mainly observed in patients receiving &gt;6 courses on the weekly schedule. Not usually seen with the every-3-week schedule. 1.11 Panitumumab Trade_Name Vectibix Classification Monoclonal antibody, anti-EGFR antibody Category Targeted agent Drug_Manufacturer Amgen Mechanism_of_Action Fully human IgG2 monoclonal antibody directed against the EGFR. Binds with nearly 40-fold higher affinity to EGFR than normal ligands EGF and TGF-alpha, which results in inhibition of EGFR. Prevents both homodimerization andheterodimerization of the EGFR, which leads to inhibition of autophosphorylation and inhibition of EGFR signaling. Inhibition of the EGFR signaling pathway results in inhibition of critical mitogenic and anti-apoptotic signals involved in proliferation, growth, invasion/metastasis, and angiogenesis. Inhibition of the EGFR pathway enhances the response to chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. In contrast to cetuximab, immunologic-mediated mechanisms are not involved in its antitumor activity. Mechanism_of_Resistance Mutations in EGFR, leading to reduced binding affinity to panitumumab. Reduced expression of EGFR. KRAS mutations, which mainly occur in codons 12 and 13. BRAF mutations. NRAS mutations. Increased expression of HER2 through gene amplification. Increased expression of HER3. Activation/induction of alternative cellular signaling pathways, such as PI3K/Akt and IGF-1R. Increased expression of lncRNA MIR100HG and two embedded miRNAs, miR-100 and miR-125, that leads to activation of Wnt signaling. Distribution Distribution in the body is not well characterized. Metabolism Metabolism of panitumumab has not been extensively characterized. Pharmacokinetic studies showed clearance of antibody was saturated at a weekly dose of 2 mg/kg. Halflife is on the order of 6-7 days. Indication FDA-approved as monotherapy for the treatment of wild-type RAS metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) following prior therapy with fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-containing regimens. Use of panitumumab is not recommended in mutant KRAS mCRC. FDA-approved for the first-line treatment of wild-type RAS mCRC in combination with FOLFOX chemotherapy. Approved in Europe in first-line treatment of wild-type RAS mCRC in combination with FOLFOX or FOLFIRI; in second-line treatment in combination with FOLFIRI for mCRC patients who have progressed on first-line oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy; and as monotherapy after progression on fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-containing regimens. Dosage_Range Recommended dose for mCRC is 6 mg/kg IV on an every-2-week schedule. An alternative schedule is 2.5 mg/kg IV every week. Drug_Interation No formal drug interactions have been characterized to date. Special_Consideration The incidence of infusion reactions is lower when compared with cetuximab, as panitumumab is a fully human antibody. Reduce infusion rate by 50% in patients who experience grade 1/2 infusion reaction for the duration of that infusion. The infusion should be terminated in patients who experience a severe infusion reaction. The level of EGFR expression does not correlate with clinical activity, and as such, EGFR testing is required for clinical use. Extended RAS testing should be performed in all patients to determine KRAS and NRAS status. Only patients whose tumors express wild-type KRAS and NRAS should receive panitumumab therapy. Development of skin toxicity appears to be a surrogate marker for panitumumab clinical activity. Refer to the prescribing information for dose modifications in the setting of skin toxicity. Use with caution in patients with underlying ILD, as these patients are at increased risk for developing worsening of their ILD. In patients who develop a skin rash, topical antibiotics such as clindamycin gel or erythromycin cream/gel or oral clindamycin, oral doxycycline, or oral minocycline may help. Patients should be warned to avoid sunlight exposure. Electrolyte status (magnesium and calcium) should be closely monitored during therapy and for up to 8 weeks after completion of therapy. Pregnancy category C. Breastfeeding should be avoided. Toxicity Pruritus, dry skin with mainly a pustular, acneiform skin rash. Presents mainly on the face and upper trunk. Improves with continued treatment and resolves upon cessation of therapy. Skin toxicity occurs in up to 90% of patients, with grade 3/4 toxicity occurring in 15% of patients. Infusion-related symptoms with fever, chills, urticaria, flushing, and headache. Usually minor in severity and observed most commonly with administration of the first infusion. Pulmonary toxicity in the form of ILD manifested by increased cough, dyspnea, and pulmonary infiltrates. Observed rarely in less than 1% of patients and more frequent in patients with underlying pulmonary disease. Hypomagnesemia. Diarrhea. Asthenia and generalized malaise in up to 10%-15% of patients. Paronychial inflammation with swelling of the lateral nail folds of the toes and fingers. Usually occurs with prolonged use of panitumumab. 1.12 Pembrolizumab Trade_Name Keytruda MK-3475 Classification Monoclonal antibody, anti-PD-1 antibody Category Immunotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitor Drug_Manufacturer Merck Mechanism_of_Action Humanized IgG4 antibody that binds to the PD-1 receptor, which is expressed on T cells, and inhibits the interaction between the PD-L1 and PD-L2 ligands and the PD-1 receptor. Blockade of the PD-1 pathway-mediated immune checkpoint enhances T-cell immune response, leading to T-cell activation and proliferation. Mechanism_of_Resistance Increased expression and/or activity of other immune checkpoint pathways (e.g., TIGIT, TIM3, and LAG3). Increased expression of other immune escape mechanisms. Increased infiltration of immune suppressive populations within the tumor microenvironment, which include Tregs, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), and M2 macrophages. Release of various cytokines, chemokines, and metabolites within the tumor microenvironment, including CSF-1, tryptophan metabolites, TGF-beta, and adenosine.

Inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3), platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFR-alpha, PDGFR-beta), and Tie-2. Inhibits oncogenic kinases such as c-Kit, RET, RAF-1, and BRAF. Inhibits fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR-1, FGFR-2), DDR2, Trk2A, Eph2A, SAPK2, PTK5, and Abl. Mechanism_of_Resistance Activation of Akt signaling. Activation of Notch-1 signaling. Increased expression and activity of the multidrug resistant-associated transporter protein 2 (MRP2). Mutations in the KRAS gene. Defects in PUMA-mediated apoptosis. Absorption Rapidly absorbed after an oral dose. Peak plasma levels are reached at a median time of 4 hours. The mean relative bioavailability of tablets compared to oral solution is 69% to 83%. Food with a high fat content increases oral bioavailability of parent drug by 48%. Distribution Highly bound (99.5%) to human plasma proteins. Metabolism Metabolized in the liver primarily by CYP3A4 and UGT1A9. The main circulating metabolites are M-2 (N-oxide) and M-5 (N-oxide and N-desmethyl), both of which have similar biological activity as parent drug. Approximately 71% of an administered drug is excreted in the feces, with 47% in parent form and 24% as metabolites, and 19% is eliminated in the urine. The terminal half-life of regorafenib is 28 hours, while the terminal half-lives of the M-2 and M-5 metabolites are approximately 25 and 51 hours, respectively. Indication FDA-approved for metastatic colorectal cancer following treatment with fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and irinotecan-based chemotherapy; an anti-VEGF therapy; and an anti-EGFR therapy if KRAS wild-type. FDA-approved for locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic GIST previously treated with imatinib and sunitinib. FDA-approved for hepatocellular cancer (HCC) following prior therapy with sorafenib. Dosage_Range Recommended dose is 160 mg PO once daily after a low-fat meal for the first 21 days of a 28-day cycle. Drug_Interaction Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, nefazodone, telithromycin, and voriconazole decrease the rate of metabolism of regorafenib, resulting in increased drug levels and potentially increased toxicity. Drugs such as rifampin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, and St. John’s Wort increase the rate of metabolism of regorafenib, resulting in its inactivation. Concomitant use of regorafenib, a UGT1A1 inhibitor, and irinotecan, a UGT1A1 substrate, may result in increased exposure of irinotecan and the active SN-38 metabolite, potentially leading to increased toxicity. Special_Consideration Regorafenib should be taken at the same time each day with a low-fat breakfast that contains less than 30% fat. No initial dosage adjustment is needed in patients with pre-existing mild or moderate hepatic disease; however, regorafenib has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic disease, and use in this population is not recommended. No dose adjustments are necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal dysfunction. Regorafenib should be held for &gt; grade 2/3 hand-foot skin reaction, symptomatic grade 2 hypertension, and any NCI CTCAE v3.0 grade 3/4 toxicity. Patients should be warned of the risk of liver toxicity, which represents a black-box warning. LFTs need to be closely monitored while on therapy. Regorafenib should be stopped permanently if a reduced dose of 80 mg is not tolerated, SGOT/SGPT &gt;20 x ULN, SGOT/SGPT &gt;3 x ULN with serum bilirubin &gt;2 x ULN, recurrence of SGOT/SGPT &gt;5 x ULN with dose reduction to 120 mg, and for any grade 4 side effects. Dose of regorafenib can be reduced to 120 mg and 80 mg, respectively, based on specific conditions, which are outlined in the full prescribing information. Use with caution when administered with agents that are metabolized and/or eliminated by the UGT1A1 pathway, such as irinotecan, as regorafenib is an inhibitor of UGT1A1. Patients receiving regorafenib along with oral warfarin anticoagulant therapy should have their coagulation parameters (PT and INR) monitored frequently, as elevations in INR and bleeding events have been observed. Closely monitor blood pressure while on therapy, especially during the first 6 weeks of therapy, and treat as needed with standard oral antihypertensive medication. Closely monitor LFTs at least every 2 weeks during the first 2 months of therapy and monthly thereafter. Skin toxicities, including rash and hand-foot reaction, should be managed early in the course of therapy with topical treatments for symptomatic relief, temporary interruption, dose reduction, and/or discontinuation. Sun exposure should be avoided, and periodic dermatologic evaluation is recommended. Regorafenib should be interrupted in patients undergoing major surgical procedures. Avoid Seville oranges, starfruit, pomelos, grapefruit, and grapefruit juice while on regorafenib therapy. Pregnancy category D. Breastfeeding should be avoided. Toxicity Hypertension occurs in nearly 30% of patients. Usually occurs within 6 weeks of starting therapy and is well controlled with oral antihypertensive medications. Hypertensive crisis has been reported rarely. Skin toxicity in the form of hand-foot syndrome and skin rash occur in up to 45% and 26%, respectively. Generally appears within the first cycle of drug treatment. Bleeding complications occur in approximately 20% of patients. Diarrhea and nausea are the most common GI side effects. Fatigue and asthenia. Hepatotoxicity with elevations in SGOT, SGPT, and serum bilirubin. Severe drug-induced liver injury resulting in death has been reported rarely. GI perforation and GI fistula occur rarely. Myocardial ischemia and/or infarction occur in about 1% of patients. CNS toxicity in the form of RPLS.
