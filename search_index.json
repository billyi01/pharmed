1.3.2 Systemic Therapy for M0 Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) 1.3.3 Systemic Therapy for M1 Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) 1.4 Principles of Genetics - prostate cancer 1.4.1 Germline Testing Inquiring about family and personal history of cancer and family history for known germline variants at time of initial diagnosis is recommended. In cases when a patient says he was tested and had negative results, the clinician should inquire about the details of testing. Direct-to-consumer genetic tests do not test for all known relevant variants. Germline genetic testing is recommended for patients with prostate cancer and any of the following: High-risk, very-high-risk, regional, or metastatic prostate cancer Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry Family history of high-risk germline mutations (eg, BRCA1/2, Lynch mutation) A positive family history of cancer: A strong family history of prostate cancer consists of: brother or father or multiple family members who were diagnosed with prostate cancer at &lt;60 years of age or who died from prostate cancer OR 3 cancers on same side of family, especially diagnoses 50 years of age: bile duct, breast, colorectal, endometrial, gastric, kidney, melanoma, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, small bowel, or urothelial cancer. Limited data suggest that prostate cancers with cribriform (ductal or intraductal) histology have increased genomic instability. Family history for known germline variants and genetic testing for germline variants should include MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 (for Lynch syndrome) and homologous recombination genes BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, PALB2, and CHEK2. Consider cancer predisposition next-generation sequencing (NGS) panel testing, which includes BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, PALB2, CHEK2, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2. Additional genes may be appropriate depending on clinical context. For example, HOXB13 is a prostate cancer risk gene that does not have clear therapeutic implications in advanced disease, but testing may be valuable for family counseling. Patient should be counseled to inform providers of any update to family history. Genetic testing in the absence of family history or clinical features (eg, high- or very-high-risk prostate cancer) may be of low yield. The prevalence of inherited (germline) DNA repair gene mutations in men with metastatic prostate cancer, unselected for family history (n = 692), was found to be 11.8% (BRCA2 5.3%, ATM 1.6%, CHEK2 1.9%, BRCA1 0.9%, RAD51D 0.4%, and PALB2 0.4%). The prevalence was 6% in the localized high-risk population in the TCGA cohort (Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network). Genetic counseling resources and support are critical and pre-test counseling is preferred when feasible, especially if family history is positive. Post-test genetic counseling is recommended if a germline mutation (pathogenic variant) is identified. Cascade testing for relatives is critical to inform the risk for familial cancers in male and female relatives. If no pathogenic variant mutations or only germline variants of unknown significance (VUS) are identified but family history is positive, genetic counseling is recommended to discuss possible participation in family studies and variant reclassification studies. Resources are available to check the known pathologic effects of genomic variants (eg, BRCA Exchange; ClinVar) Information regarding germline mutations in patients with metastatic disease can be used to inform future treatments or to determine eligibility for clinical trials. 1.4.2 Somatic Tumor Testing It is recommended evaluating tumor for alterations in homologous recombination DNA repair genes, such as BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, PALB2, FANCA, RAD51D, CHEK2, and CDK12, in patients with metastatic prostate cancer. This testing can be considered in men with regional prostate cancer. At present, this information may be used for genetic counseling, early use of platinum chemotherapy, olaparib or rucaparib, and/or eligibility for clinical trials (eg, PARP inhibitors). Clinical trials may include additional candidate DNA repair genes under investigation as molecular biomarkers. If mutations in BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, PALB2, and CHEK2 are found and/or there is a strong family history of cancer, refer to genetic counseling for confirmatory germline testing. Somatic testing may require repetition when prostate cancer progresses after treatment. It is strongly advocated a metastatic biopsy for histologic and molecular evaluation. When this is not possible, plasma ctDNA assay is an option, preferably at time of biochemical (PSA) or radiographic progression in order to maximize yield. Patients should be informed that somatic tumor sequencing has the potential to uncover germline findings. However, virtually no somatic NGS test is designed or validated for germline assessment. Therefore, overinterpretation of germline findings should be avoided. If a germline mutation is suspected, the patient should be recommended for follow-up with genetic counseling and dedicated germline testing. Tumor testing for MSI-H or dMMR can be considered in patients with regional or castration-naïve metastatic prostate cancer and is recommended in patients with metastatic CRPC. DNA analysis for MSI and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for MMR are different assays measuring the same biological effect. If MSI is used, testing using an NGS assay validated for prostate cancer is preferred. If MSI-H or dMMR is found, refer to genetic counseling to assess for the possibility of Lynch syndrome. MSI-H or dMMR indicate eligibility for pembrolizumab in later lines of treatment for CRPC. 1.5 Principles of Imaging - prostate cancer 1.5.1 Goals of Imaging Imaging is performed for the detection and characterization of disease to select treatment or guide change in management. Imaging techniques can evaluate anatomic or functional parameters. Anatomic imaging techniques include plain film radiographs, ultrasound, CT, and MRI. Functional imaging techniques include radionuclide bone scan, PET/CT, and advanced MRI techniques, such as spectroscopy and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). 1.5.2 Efficacy of Imaging The utility of imaging for men with early PSA persistence/recurrence after RP depends on risk group prior to operation, pathologic Gleason grade and stage, PSA, and PSA doubling time (PSADT) after recurrence. Low- and intermediate-risk groups with low serum PSAs postoperatively have a very low risk of positive bone scans or CT scans. Frequency of imaging should be based on individual risk, age, PSADT, Gleason score, and overall health. Conventional bone scans are rarely positive in asymptomatic men with PSA &lt;10 ng/mL. The relative risk for bone metastasis or death increases as PSADT shortens. Bone imaging should be performed more frequently when PSADT 8 months, where there appears to be an inflection point. 1.5.3 Plain Radiography Plain radiography can be used to evaluate symptomatic regions in the skeleton. However, conventional plain x-rays will not detect a bone lesion until nearly 50% of the mineral content of the bone is lost or gained. CT or MRI may be more useful to assess fracture risk as these modalities permit more accurate assessment of cortical involvement than plain films where osteoblastic lesions may obscure cortical involvement. 1.5.4 Ultrasound Ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to image small regions of the body. Standard ultrasound imaging provides anatomic information. Vascular flow can be assessed using Doppler ultrasound techniques. Endorectal ultrasound is used to guide transrectal biopsies of the prostate. Endorectal ultrasound can be considered for patients with suspected recurrence after RP to guide prostate bed biopsy. Advanced ultrasound techniques for imaging of the prostate and for differentiation between prostate cancer and prostatitis are under evaluation. 1.5.5 Bone Imaging The use of the term “bone scan” refers to the conventional technetium-99m-MDP bone scan in which technetium is taken up by bone that is turning over and imaged with a gamma camera using planar imaging or 3-D imaging with single-photon emission CT (SPECT). Sites of increased uptake imply accelerated bone turnover and may indicate metastatic disease. Osseous metastatic disease may be diagnosed based on the overall pattern of activity, or in conjunction with anatomic imaging. Bone scan is indicated in the initial evaluation of patients at high risk for skeletal metastases. Bone scan can be considered for the evaluation of the post-prostatectomy patient when there is failure of PSA to fall to undetectable levels, or when there is undetectable PSA after RP with a subsequent detectable PSA that increases on 2 or more subsequent determinations. Bone scan can be considered for the evaluation of patients with an increasing PSA or positive DRE after RT if the patient is a candidate for additional local therapy or systemic therapy. Bone scans are helpful to monitor metastatic prostate cancer to determine the clinical benefit of systemic therapy. However, new lesions seen on an initial post-treatment bone scan, compared to the pre-treatment baseline scan, may not indicate disease progression. New lesions in the setting of a falling PSA or soft tissue response and in the absence of pain progression at that site may indicate bone scan flare or an osteoblastic healing reaction. For this reason, a confirmatory bone scan 8–12 weeks later is warranted to determine true progression from flare reaction. Additional new lesions favor progression. Stable scans make continuation of treatment reasonable. Bone scan flare is common, particularly on initiation of new hormonal therapy, and may be observed in nearly half of patients treated with the newer agents, enzalutamide and abiraterone. Similar flare phenomena may exist with other imaging modalities, such as CT or PET/CT imaging. Bone scans and soft tissue imaging (CT or MRI) in men with metastatic prostate cancer or non-metastatic progressive prostate cancer may be obtained regularly during systemic therapy to assess clinical benefit. Bone scans should be performed for symptoms and as often as every 6–12 mo to monitor ADT. The need for soft tissue images remains unclear. In CRPC, 8- to 12-week imaging intervals appear reasonable. PET/CT for detection of bone metastatic disease in patients with M0 CRPC. F-18 sodium fluoride PET/CT or PET/MRI may be used to detect bone metastatic disease with greater sensitivity but less specificity than standard bone scan imaging. Plain films, CT, MRI, F-18 sodium fluoride PET/CT or PET/MRI, C-11 choline PET/CT or PET/MRI, or F-18 fluciclovine PET/CT or PET/MRI can be considered for equivocal results on initial bone scan. 1.5.6 Computed Tomography CT provides a high level of anatomic detail, and may detect gross extracapsular disease, nodal metastatic disease, and/or visceral metastatic disease. CT is generally not sufficient to evaluate the prostate gland. CT may be performed with intravenous contrast, and CT technique should be optimized to maximize diagnostic utility while minimizing radiation dose. CT can be used for examination of the pelvis and/or abdomen for initial evaluation and as part of workup for recurrence or progression. 1.5.7 Magnetic Resonance Imaging The strengths of MRI include high soft tissue contrast and characterization, multiparametric image acquisition, multiplanar imaging capability, and advanced computational methods to assess function. MRI can be performed with and without the administration of intravenous contrast material. Resolution of MRI images in the pelvis can be augmented using an endorectal coil. Standard MRI techniques can be used for examination of the pelvis and/or abdomen for initial evaluation and as part of workup for recurrence or progression. MRI may be considered in patients after RP when PSA fails to fall to undetectable levels or when an undetectable PSA becomes detectable and increases on 2 or more subsequent determinations, or after RT for increasing PSA or positive DRE if the patient is a candidate for additional local therapy. MRI-US fusion biopsy may improve the detection of higher grade (Grade Group 2) cancers. mpMRI can be used in the staging and characterization of prostate cancer. mpMRI images are defined as images acquired with at least one more sequence in addition to the anatomical T2-weighted images, such as DWI or dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) images. mpMRI may be used to better risk stratify men who are considering active surveillance. Additionally, mpMRI may detect large and poorly differentiated prostate cancer (Grade Group 2) and detect extracapsular extension (T staging) and is preferred over CT for abdominal/pelvic staging. mpMRI has been shown to be equivalent to CT scan for pelvic lymph node evaluation. 1.5.8 Positron Emission Tomography (PET) F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT should not be used routinely for staging prostate cancer since data are limited in patients with prostate cancer. The use of PET/CT or PET/MRI imaging using tracers other than F-18 FDG for staging of small-volume recurrent or metastatic prostate cancer is a rapidly developing field wherein most of the data are derived from single-institution series or registry studies. FDA clearance and reimbursement for some tests makes unlikely the conduct of clinical trials to evaluate their utility and impact upon oncologic outcome. PET/CT or PET/MRI for detection of biochemically recurrent disease C-11 choline or F-18 fluciclovine PET/CT or PET/MRI may be used to detect small-volume disease in soft tissues and in bone. Histologic confirmation is recommended whenever feasible due to significant rates of false positivity. High variability among PET/CT or PET/MRI equipment, protocols, interpretation, and institutions provides challenges for application and interpretation of the utility of PET/CT or PET/MRI. PET/CT or PET/MRI results may change treatment but may not change oncologic outcome. When the worst prognosis patients from one risk group move to the higher risk group, the average outcome of both risk groups will improve even if treatment has no impact on disease. This phenomenon is known as the Will Rogers effect, in which the improved outcomes of both groups could be falsely attributed to improvement in treatment, but would be due only to improved risk group assignment. As an example, F-18 sodium fluoride PET/CT may categorize some patients as M1b who would have been categorized previously as M0 using a bone scan (stage migration). Absent any change in the effectiveness of therapy, the overall survival of both M1b and M0 groups would improve. The definition of M0 and M1 disease for randomized clinical trials that added docetaxel or abiraterone to ADT was based on CT and conventional radionuclide bone scans. Results suggest that overall survival of M1 disease is improved, whereas progression-free but not overall survival of M0 disease is improved. Therefore, a subset of patients now diagnosed with M1 disease using F-18 sodium fluoride PET/CT might not benefit from the more intensive therapy used in these trials and could achieve equivalent overall survival from less intensive therapy aimed at M0 disease. Carefully designed clinical trials using proper staging will be necessary to prove therapeutic benefit, rather than making assumptions compromised by stage migration. 1.6 Principles of Active Surveillance and Observation Overdiagnosis and overtreatment of prostate cancer is concerned. Patients and their physicians (ie, urologist, radiation oncologist, medical oncologist, primary care physician) consider active surveillance based on careful consideration of the patient’s prostate cancer risk profile, age, and health. Active surveillance and observation both involve no more often than every-6-month monitoring but active surveillance may involve surveillance prostate biopsies. Evidence of progression will prompt conversion to potentially curative treatment in active surveillance patients, whereas monitoring continues until symptoms develop or are imminent (ie, PSA &gt;100 ng/mL or change in exam) in observation patients, who will then begin palliative ADT. Active surveillance is preferred for men with very-low-risk prostate cancer and life expectancy 20 years and for men with low-risk prostate cancer and life expectancy 10 years. Observation is preferred for men with low-risk prostate cancer with life expectancy &lt;10 years. Patients with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer may be considered for active surveillance. Active surveillance involves actively monitoring the course of disease with the expectation to intervene with curative intent if the cancer progresses. Cancer progression may have occurred if: Gleason Grade 4 or 5 cancer is found upon repeat prostate biopsy. Prostate cancer is found in a greater number of prostate biopsies or occupies a greater extent of prostate biopsy. Patients with clinically localized prostate cancers who are candidates for definitive treatment and choose active surveillance should have regular follow-up. Follow-up should be more rigorous in younger men than in older men. Follow-up should include: Consider confirmatory prostate biopsy with or without mpMRI and with or without mulecular tumor analysis to establish candidacy for active surveillance. Molecular tumor analysis also can be used to confirm candidacy in patients with low and favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer. Assess PSA no more often than every 6 months unless clinically indicated. Perform DRE no more often than every 12 months unless clinically indicated. Repeat prostate biopsy no more often than every 12 months unless clinically indicated. Repeat mpMRI no more often than every 12 months unless clinically indicated. Needle biopsy of the prostate should be repeated within 6 months of diagnosis if initial biopsy was &lt;10 cores or assessment discordant (eg, palpable tumor contralateral to side of positive biopsy). MRI-US fusion biopsy may improve the detection of higher grade (Grade Group 2) cancers. A repeat prostate biopsy should be considered if prostate exam changes, MRI suggests more aggressive disease, or PSA increases, but no parameter is very reliable for detecting prostate cancer progression. A repeat prostate biopsy should be considered no more often than annually to assess for disease progression, because PSA kinetics may not be as reliable for predicting progression. Repeat prostate biopsies are not indicated when life expectancy is less than 10 years or appropriate when men are on observation. PSADT appears unreliable for identification of progressive disease that remains curable. 1.6.1 Advantages of active surveillance: About 2/3 of men eligible for active surveillance may avoid or delay treatment. Men will avoid of possible side effects of definitive therapy that may be unnecessary. Quality of life/normal activities will potentially be less affected. Risk of unnecessary treatment of small, indolent cancers will be reduced. 1.6.2 Disadvantages of active surveillance: Although very low, there will be a chance of missed opportunity for cure. About 1/3 of men will require treatment, although treatment delays do not seem to impact cure rate. Periodic follow-up mpMRI and prostate biopsies may be necessary. 1.6.3 Advantages of observation: Men will avoid possible side effects of unnecessary definitive therapy and early initiation and/or continuous ADT. 1.6.4 Disadvantages of observation: There will be a risk of urinary retention or pathologic fracture without prior symptoms or concerning PSA levels. 1.7 Principles of Radiation Therapy Definitive Radiation Therapy General Principles - Highly conformal RT techniques should be used to treat localized prostate cancer. - Photon or proton EBRT are both effective at achieving highly conformal radiotherapy with acceptable and similar biochemical control and long-term side effect profiles. - Brachytherapy boost, when added to EBRT plus ADT in men with NCCN intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer, has demonstrated improved biochemical control over EBRT plus ADT alone in randomized trials, but with higher toxicity. - Ideally, the accuracy of treatment should be verified by daily prostate localization, with any of the following: techniques of IGRT using CT, ultrasound, implanted fiducials, or electromagnetic targeting/tracking. Endorectal balloons may be used to improve prostate immobilization. Biocompatible and biodegradable perirectal spacer materials may be implanted between the prostate and rectum in patients undergoing external radiotherapy with organ-confined prostate cancer in order to displace the rectum from high radiation dose regions. A randomized phase III trial demonstrated reduced rectal bleeding in patients undergoing the procedure compared to controls. Retrospective data also support its use in similar patients undergoing brachytherapy. Patients with obvious rectal invasion or visible T3 and posterior extension should not undergo perirectal spacer implantation. - Various fractionation and dose regimens can be considered depending on the clinical scenario. Dose escalation has been proven to achieve the best biochemical control in men with intermediate- and high-risk disease. - SBRT is acceptable in practices with appropriate technology, physics, and clinical expertise. SBRT for metastases can be considered in the following circumstances: - In a patient with limited metastatic disease to the vertebra or paravertebral region when ablation is the goal (eg, concern for impending fracture or tumor encroachment on spinal nerves or vertebra) - In a patient with oligometastatic progression where progressionfree survival is the goal - In a symptomatic patient where the lesion occurs in or immediately adjacent to a previously irradiated treatment field. - Biologically effective dose (BED) modeling with the linear-quadratic equation may not be accurate for extremely hypofractionated (SBRT/SABR) radiation. - For brachytherapy: - Patients with a very large prostate or very small prostate, symptoms of bladder outlet obstruction (high International Prostate Symptom Score [IPSS]), or a previous transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) are more difficult to implant and may suffer increased risk of side effects. Neoadjuvant ADT may be used to shrink the prostate to an acceptable size; however, increased toxicity would be expected from ADT and prostate size may not decline in some men despite neoadjuvant ADT. Potential toxicity of ADT must be balanced against the potential benefit of target reduction. - Post-implant dosimetry must be performed to document the quality of the low dose-rate (LDR) implant. Definitive Radiation Therapy by Risk Group Very low risk Men with NCCN very-low-risk prostate cancer are encouraged to pursue active surveillance. Low risk Men with NCCN low-risk prostate cancer are encouraged to pursue active surveillance. Prophylactic lymph node radiation should NOT be performed routinely. ADT or antiandrogen therapy should NOT be used routinely. Favorable intermediate risk Prophylactic lymph node radiation is not performed routinely, and ADT or antiandrogen therapy is not used routinely. Prophylactic lymph node radiation and/or ADT use is reasonable if additional risk assessments suggest aggressive tumor behavior. Unfavorable intermediate risk Prophylactic nodal radiation can be considered if additional risk assessments suggest aggressive tumor behavior. ADT should be used unless additional risk assessments suggest lessaggressive tumor behavior or if medically contraindicated. The duration of ADT can be reduced when combined with EBRT and brachytherapy. Brachytherapy combined with ADT (without EBRT), or SBRT combined with ADT can be considered if delivering longer courses of EBRT would present medical or social hardship. High and very high risk Prophylactic nodal radiation should be considered. ADT is required unless medically contraindicated. Brachytherapy combined with ADT (without EBRT), or SBRT combined with ADT, can be considered if delivering longer courses of EBRT would present a medical or social hardship. Regional disease Nodal radiation should be performed. Clinically positive nodes should be dose-escalated as dose-volume histogram parameters allow. ADT is required unless medically contraindicated, and the addition of abiraterone or fine-particle abiraterone to ADT can be considered. Low-volume metastatic disease Radiation therapy to the prostate is an option in patients with low-volume castration-naïve metastatic disease, without contraindications to radiotherapy. ADT is required unless medically contraindicated. This recommendation is based on the STAMPEDE phase 3 randomized trial, which randomized 2,061 men to standard systemic therapy with or without radiotherapy to the primary. The overall cohort had a significant improvement from the addition of radiotherapy to the primary in failure-free survival, but not overall survival. The prespecified low-volume subset had a significant improvement in both failure-free survival and overall survival. Minimizing toxicity is paramount when delivering radiation therapy to the primary in patients with metastatic disease. It remains uncertain whether treatment of regional nodes in addition to the primary improves outcomes; nodal treatment should be performed in the context of a clinical trial. Dose escalation beyond biologically effective dose equivalents of the two dose prescriptions used in STAMPEDE (55 Gy in 20 fractions or 6 Gy x 6 fractions) is not recommended given the known increase in toxicity from dose intensification without overall survival improvement in localized disease. Brachytherapy is not recommended outside of a clinical trial, as safety and efficacy have not been established in this patient population. High-volume metastatic disease Radiation therapy to the prostate should NOT be performed in men with high-volume metastatic disease outside the context of a clinical trial unless for palliative intent. This recommendation is based on two randomized trials, HORRAD and STAMPEDE, neither of which showed an improvement in overall survival from the addition of radiotherapy to the primary when combined with standard systemic therapy. Salvage Brachytherapy Permanent LDR or temporary high dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy is a treatment option for pathologically confirmed local recurrence after EBRT or brachytherapy. Subjects should have restaging imaging according to the NCCN high-risk stratification group to rule out regional nodal or metastatic disease. Patients should be counseled that salvage brachytherapy significantly increases the probability of urologic, sexual, and bowel toxicity compared to primary brachytherapy. Post-Prostatectomy Radiation Therapy The panel recommends use of nomograms and consideration of age and comorbidities, clinical and pathologic information, PSA levels, and PSADT to individualize treatment discussion. Decipher molecular assay is recommended to inform adjuvant treatment, if adverse features are found after RP. The panel recommends consultation with the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO)/American Urological Association (AUA) Guidelines. Evidence supports offering adjuvant/salvage RT in most men with adverse pathologic features or detectable PSA and no evidence of disseminated disease. Indications for adjuvant RT include pT3a disease, positive margin(s), or seminal vesicle involvement. Adjuvant RT is usually given within 1 year after RP and after operative side effects have improved/stabilized. Patients with positive surgical margins may benefit the most. Indications for salvage RT include an undetectable PSA that becomes subsequently detectable and increases on 2 measurements or a PSA that remains persistently detectable after RP. Treatment is more effective when pre-treatment PSA is low and PSADT is long. The recommended prescribed doses for adjuvant/salvage postprostatectomy RT are 64–72 Gy in standard fractionation. Biopsyproven gross recurrence may require higher doses. EBRT with 2 years of anti-androgen therapy with 150 mg/day of bicalutamide demonstrated improved overall and metastasis-free survival on a prospective randomized trial (RTOG 9601) versus radiation alone in the salvage setting. EBRT with 6 months of ADT improved biochemical or clinical progression at 5 years on a prospective randomized trial (GETUG-16) versus radiation alone. Nuclear medicine advanced imaging techniques can be useful for localizing disease with PSA levels as low as 0.5 ng/mL. Nomograms, and tumor-based molecular assays, can be used to prognosticate risk of metastasis and prostate cancer-specific mortality in men with adverse risk features after RP. Target volumes include the prostate bed and may include the whole pelvis according to physician discretion. Radiopharmaceutical Therapy - Radium-223 is an alpha-emitting radiopharmaceutical that has been shown to extend survival in men who have CRPC with symptomatic bone metastases, but no visceral metastases. Radium-223 alone has not been shown to extend survival in men with visceral metastases or bulky nodal disease (&gt;3–4 cm). Radium-223 differs from betaemitting agents, such as samarium-153 and strontium-89, which are palliative and have no survival advantage. Radium-223 causes double-strand DNA breaks and has a short radius of activity. Grade 3–4 hematologic toxicity (ie, 2% neutropenia, 3% thrombocytopenia, 6% anemia) occurs at low frequency. - Radium-223 is administered intravenously once a month for 6 months by an appropriately licensed facility, usually in nuclear medicine or RT departments. - Prior to the initial dose, patients must have absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 1.5 x 10/L, platelet count 100 x 10/L, and hemoglobin 10 g/dL. - Prior to subsequent doses, patients must have ANC 1 x 10/L and platelet count 50 x 10/L (per label). Radium-223 should be discontinued if a delay of 6–8 weeks does not result in the return of blood counts to these levels. - Non-hematologic side effects are generally mild, and include nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. These symptoms may occur because radium-223 is eliminated predominantly by fecal excretion. - Radium-223 is not intended to be used in combination with chemotherapy due to the potential for additive myelosuppression, except in a clinical trial. - Radium-223 may increase fracture risk when given concomitantly with abiraterone. - Radium-223 is not recommended for use in combination with docetaxel or any other systemic therapy except ADT. - Concomitant use of denosumab or zoledronic acid is recommended; it does not interfere with the beneficial effects of radium-223 on survival. Palliative Radiotherapy - 8 Gy as a single dose is as effective for pain palliation at any bony site as longer courses of radiation, but re-treatment rates are higher. - Widespread bone metastases can be palliated using strontium-89 or samarium-153 with or without focal external beam radiation. - 30 Gy in 10 fractions or 37.5 Gy in 15 fractions may be used as alternative palliative dosing depending on clinical scenario. 1.8 Principles of Surgery Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection - An extended PLND will discover metastases approximately twice as often as a limited PLND. Extended PLND provides more complete staging and may cure some men with microscopic metastases; therefore, an extended PLND is preferred when PLND is performed. - An extended PLND includes removal of all node-bearing tissue from an area bound by the external iliac vein anteriorly, the pelvic sidewall laterally, the bladder wall medially, the floor of the pelvis posteriorly, Cooper’s ligament distally, and the internal iliac artery proximally. - A PLND can be excluded in patients with &lt;2% predicated probability of nodal metastases by nomograms, although some patients with lymph node metastases will be missed. - PLND can be performed using an open, laparoscopic, or robotic technique. Radical Prostatectomy - RP is an appropriate therapy for any patient with clinically localized prostate cancer that can be completely excised surgically, who has a life expectancy of 10 years, and who has no serious comorbid conditions that would contraindicate an elective operation. - High-volume surgeons in high-volume centers generally provide better outcomes. - Blood loss can be substantial with RP, but can be reduced by using laparoscopic or robotic assistance or by careful control of the dorsal vein complex and periprostatic vessels when performed open. - Urinary incontinence can be reduced by preservation of urethral length beyond the apex of the prostate and avoiding damage to the distal sphincter mechanism. Bladder neck preservation may decrease the risk of incontinence. Anastomotic strictures increase the risk of long-term incontinence. - Recovery of erectile function is directly related to age at RP, preoperative erectile function, and the degree of preservation of the cavernous nerves. Replacement of resected nerves with nerve grafts has not been shown to be beneficial. Early restoration of erections may improve late recovery. Salvage Radical Prostatectomy - Salvage RP is an option for highly selected patients with local recurrence after EBRT, brachytherapy, or cryotherapy in the absence of metastases, but the morbidity (ie, incontinence, loss of erection, anastomotic stricture) is high and the operation should be performed by surgeons who are experienced with salvage RP. 1.9 Principles of Androgen Deprivation Therapy 1.9.1 ADT for Clinically Localized (N0,M0) Disease Neoadjuvant ADT for RP is strongly discouraged outside of a clinical trial. ADT should not be used as monotherapy in clinically localized prostate cancer unless there is a contraindication to definitive local therapy such as life expectancy 5 years and comorbidities. Under those circumstances, ADT may be used. Giving ADT before, during, and/or after radiation (neoadjuvant, concurrent, and/or adjuvant ADT) prolongs survival in selected radiation-managed patients. Options are: LHRH agonist alone Goserelin, histrelin, leuprolide, or triptorelin LHRH agonist plus first-generation antiandrogen Nilutamide, flutamide, or bicalutamide LHRH antagonist Degarelix Studies of short-term (4–6 mo) and long-term (2–3 y) neoadjuvant, concurrent, and/or adjuvant ADT all have used combined androgen blockade. Whether the addition of an antiandrogen is necessary requires further study. The largest randomized trial to date using the antiandrogen bicalutamide alone at high dose (150 mg) showed a delay in recurrence of disease but no improvement in survival; however, longer follow-up is needed. 1.9.2 ADT for Regional (N1,M0) Disease Patients with N1,M0 prostate cancer and a life expectancy &gt;5 years can be treated with: EBRT and neoadjuvant, concurrent, and/or adjuvant ADT as for patients with N0,M0 disease (see above) without abiraterone EBRT and neoadjuvant, concurrent, and/or adjuvant LHRH agonist or LHRH antagonist with abiraterone ADT alone or with abiraterone (see below). Abiraterone should be given with concurrent steroid: Prednisone 5 mg orally once daily for the standard formulation Methylprednisolone 4 mg orally twice daily for the fine-particle formulation. Neither formulation of abiraterone should be given following progression on the other formulation. Abiraterone with ADT should be considered for a total of 2 years for those men with N1 disease who are treated with radiation to the prostate and pelvic nodes. Options for ADT alone or with abiraterone are: Orchiectomy LHRH agonist alone Goserelin, histrelin, leuprolide, or triptorelin LHRH agonist plus first-generation antiandrogen Nilutamide, flutamide, or bicalutamide LHRH antagonist Degarelix Orchiectomy plus abiraterone LHRH agonist plus abiraterone LHRH antagonist plus abiraterone Patients with regional disease and life expectancy &lt;5 years who chose ADT can receive LHRH agonist, LHRH antagonist, or orchiectomy. 1.9.3 ADT for pN1 Disease In one randomized trial, immediate and continuous use of ADT in men with positive nodes following RP resulted in significantly improved overall survival compared to men who received delayed ADT. Therefore, such patients should be considered for immediate LHRH agonist, LHRH antagonist, or orchiectomy. EBRT may be added, in which case the ADT options are as for neoadjuvant, concurrent, and/or adjuvant ADT for clinically localized disease. Many of the side effects of continuous ADT are cumulative over time on ADT. 1.9.4 ADT for M0 PSA Persistence/Recurrence After RP or EBRT (ADT for M0 Castration-Naïve Disease) The timing of ADT for patients whose only evidence of cancer after definitive treatment is an increasing PSA is influenced by PSA velocity, patient anxiety, the short- and long-term side effects of ADT, and the underlying comorbidities of the patient. Most patients will have a good 15-year prognosis, but their prognosis is best approximated by the absolute level of PSA, the rate of change in the PSA level (PSADT), and the initial stage, grade, and PSA level at the time of definitive therapy. Earlier ADT may be better than delayed ADT, although the definitions of early and late (what level of PSA) are controversial. Since the benefit of early ADT is not clear, treatment should be individualized until definitive studies are done. Patients with a shorter PSADT (or a rapid PSA velocity) and an otherwise long life expectancy should be encouraged to consider ADT earlier. Some patients are candidates for salvage therapy after PSA persistence/recurrence. Men with prolonged PSADTs (&gt;12 months) and who are older are candidates for observation. Men who choose ADT should consider intermittent ADT. A phase 3 trial that compared intermittent to continuous ADT showed that intermittent ADT was not inferior to continuous ADT with respect to survival, and quality of life was better for the intermittent ADT arm. The 7% increase in prostate cancer deaths in the intermittent ADT arm was balanced by more non-prostate cancer deaths in the continuous ADT arm. An unplanned subset analysis showed that men with Grade Group 4 or 5 prostate cancer in the continuous arm had a median overall survival that was 14 months longer (8 years) than those in the intermittent arm (6.8 years). ADT options are: M0 RP PSA Persistence/Recurrence: EBRT +/- neoadjuvant, concurrent, and/or adjuvant ADT. M0 EBRT PSA Persistence/Recurrence, TRUS-biopsy negative or M0 PSA Persistence/Recurrence after progression on salvage EBRT: Orchiectomy LHRH agonist alone – Goserelin, histrelin, leuprolide, or triptorelin LHRH agonist plus first-generation antiandrogen – Nilutamide, flutamide, or bicalutamide LHRH antagonist – Degarelix 1.9.5 ADT for Metastatic Castration-Naïve Disease ADT is the gold standard for men with metastatic prostate cancer. A phase 3 trial compared continuous ADT to intermittent ADT, but the study could not demonstrate non-inferiority for survival. However, quality-of-life measures for erectile function and mental health were better in the intermittent ADT arm after 3 months of ADT compared to the continuous ADT arm. In addition, three meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials failed to show a difference in survival between intermittent and continuous ADT. Close monitoring of PSA and testosterone levels and possibly imaging is required when using intermittent ADT, especially during off-treatment periods, and patients may need to switch to continuous ADT upon signs of disease progression. Treatment options for men with M1 castration-naïve disease are: Orchiectomy ± docetaxel LHRH agonist alone ± docetaxel (a first-generation antiandrogen must be given for 7 days to prevent testosterone flare if metastases are present in weight-bearing bone) Goserelin, histrelin, leuprolide, or triptorelin LHRH agonist plus first-generation antiandrogen ± docetaxel Nilutamide, flutamide, or bicalutamide LHRH antagonist ± docetaxel Degarelix Orchiectomy plus abiraterone, enzalutamide, or apalutamide LHRH agonist plus abiraterone, enzalutamide, or apalutamide LHRH antagonist plus abiraterone, enzalutamide, or apalutamide Abiraterone should be given with concurrent steroid. Neither formulation of abiraterone should be given following progression on the other formulation. When EBRT to primary is given with ADT in low-volume M1, the options are LHRH agonist, LHRH antagonist, and orchiectomy. Two randomized phase 3 clinical trials of abiraterone with prednisone plus ADT in men with castration-naïve metastatic prostate cancer demonstrated improved overall survival over ADT alone. Adverse events were higher with abiraterone and prednisone but were generally mild in nature and were largely related to mineralocorticoid excess (ie, hypertension, hypokalemia, edema), hormonal effects (ie, fatigue, hot flushes), and liver toxicity. Cardiac events, severe hypertension, and liver toxicity were increased with abiraterone. A double-blind randomized phase 3 clinical trial of apalutamide plus ADT in men with castration-naïve metastatic prostate cancer demonstrated improved overall survival over ADT alone. Adverse events that were more common with apalutamide than with placebo included rash, hypothyroidism, and ischemic heart disease. An open-label randomized phase 3 clinical trial of enzalutamide plus ADT in men with castration-naïve metastatic prostate cancer demonstrated improved overall survival over ADT alone. In a separate double-blind randomized phase 3 clinical, enzalutamide reduced the risk of metastatic progression or death compared with placebo. Adverse events associated with enzalutamide included fatigue, seizures, and hypertension. 1.9.6 Secondary Hormone Therapy for M0 or M1 CRPC Androgen receptor activation and autocrine/paracrine androgen synthesis are potential mechanisms of recurrence of prostate cancer during ADT (CRPC). Thus, castrate levels of testosterone (&lt;50 ng/dL) should be maintained by continuing LHRH agonist or antagonist while additional therapies are applied. Once the tumor becomes resistant to initial ADT, there are a variety of options that may afford clinical benefit. The available options are based on whether the patient has evidence of metastases by conventional imaging, M0 CRPC vs. M1 CRPC, and whether or not the patient is symptomatic. Administration of secondary hormonal therapy can include: Second-generation antiandrogen Apalutamide (for M0 and PSADT 10 months) Darolutamide (for M0 and PSADT 10 months) Enzalutamide (for M0 and PSADT 10 months or M1) Androgen metabolism inhibitor  Abiraterone + prednisone (for M1 only)  Fine-particle abiraterone + methylprednisolone (for M1 only) Other secondary hormone therapy (for M0 or M1)  Ketoconazole  Ketoconazole plus hydrocortisone  First-generation antiandrogen (nilutamide, flutamide, or bicalutamide)  Corticosteroids (hydrocortisone, prednisone, or dexamethasone)  Estrogens including diethylstilbestrol (DES)  Antiandrogen withdrawal • Abiraterone should be given with concurrent steroid, either prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily for the standard formulation or methylprednisolone 4 mg orally twice daily for the fine-particle formulation. Neither formulation of abiraterone should be given following progression on the other formulation. • Ketoconazole ± hydrocortisone should not be used if the disease progressed on abiraterone. • DES has cardiovascular and thromboembolic side effects at any dose, but frequency is dose and agent dependent. DES should be initiated at 1 mg/day and increased, if necessary, to achieve castrate levels of serum testosterone (&lt;50 ng/dL). Other estrogens delivered topically or parenterally may have less frequent side effects but data are limited. • A phase 3 study of patients with M0 CRPC and a PSADT 10 months showed apalutamide (240 mg/day) improved the primary endpoint of metastasis-free survival over placebo (40.5 months vs. 16.2 months). After a median follow-up of 52 months, final overall survival analysis showed an improved median overall survival with apalutamide versus placebo (73.9 months vs. 59.9 months). Adverse events included rash (24% vs. 5.5%), fracture (11% vs. 6.5%), and hypothyroidism (8% vs. 2%). Bone support should be used in patients receiving apalutamide. • A phase 3 study of patients with M0 CRPC and a PSADT 10 months showed enzalutamide (160 mg/day) improved the primary endpoint of metastasis-free survival over placebo (36.6 months vs. 14.7 months). Median overall survival was longer in the in the enzalutamide group than in the placebo group (67.0 months vs. 56.3 months). Adverse events included falls and nonpathologic fractures (17% vs. 8%), hypertension (12% vs. 5%), major adverse cardiovascular events (5% vs. 3%), and mental impairment disorders (5% vs. 2%). Bone support should be used in patients receiving enzalutamide. • A phase 3 study of patients with M0 CRPC and a PSADT 10 months showed darolutamide (600 mg twice daily) improved the primary endpoint of metastasis-free survival over placebo (40.4 months vs. 18.4 months). Overall survival at 3 years was 83% (95% CI, 80–86) in the darolutamide group compared with 77% (95% CI, 72–81) in the placebo group. Adverse events that occurred more frequently in the treatment arm included fatigue (12.1% vs. 8.7%), pain in an extremity (5.8% vs. 3.2%), and rash (2.9% vs. 0.9%). The incidence of fractures was similar between darolutamide and placebo (4.2% vs. 3.6%). • In a randomized controlled trial in the setting of M1 CRPC prior to docetaxel chemotherapy, abiraterone, and low-dose prednisone (5 mg BID) compared to prednisone alone improved radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS), time to initiation of chemotherapy, time to onset or worsening of pain, and time to deterioration of performance status. An improvement in overall survival was demonstrated. Use of abiraterone and prednisone in this setting is a category 1 recommendation. The side effects of abiraterone that require ongoing monitoring include hypertension, hypokalemia, peripheral edema, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, liver injury, and fatigue, as well as the known side effects of ADT and long-term corticosteroid use. • A phase 3 study of docetaxel-naïve men with M1 CRPC showed that enzalutamide (160 mg daily) resulted in significant improvement in rPFS and overall survival. The use of enzalutamide in this setting is category 1. The side effects of enzalutamide that require long-term monitoring include fatigue, diarrhea, hot flashes, headache, and seizures (reported in 0.9% of men on enzalutamide). • For symptomatic patients with M1 CRPC, all secondary hormone options listed above are allowed, but initial use of docetaxel may be preferred. Both randomized trials of abiraterone and enzalutamide in the pre-docetaxel setting were conducted in men who had no or minimal symptoms due to M1 CRPC. How these agents compare to docetaxel for pain palliation in this population of patients is not clear. Both drugs have palliative effects in the post-docetaxel setting. Both abiraterone and enzalutamide are approved in this pre-docetaxel setting and have category 1 recommendations. Both drugs are suitable options for men who are not good candidates to receive docetaxel. • In the post-docetaxel M1 CRPC population, enzalutamide and abiraterone plus prednisone have been shown to extend survival in randomized controlled trials. Therefore, each agent has a category 1 recommendation. • Two randomized clinical trials (STRIVE and TERRAIN) showed that 160 mg/day enzalutamide improved PFS compared to 50 mg/day bicalutamide in men with treatment-naïve M1 CRPC and, therefore, enzalutamide may be the preferred option in this setting. However, bicalutamide can still be considered in some patients, given the different side effect profiles of the agents and the increased cost of enzalutamide. • Evidence-based guidance on the sequencing of agents in either pre- or post-docetaxel remains unavailable. ADT for Patients on Observation Who Require Treatment and Those with Life Expectancy 5 Years • Treatment for patients who progressed on observation of localized disease is LHRH agonist or antagonist (category 2B for LHRH antagonist) or orchiectomy. Optimal ADT • LHRH agonist or antagonist (medical castration) and bilateral orchiectomy (surgical castration) are equally effective. • Combined androgen blockade (medical or surgical castration combined with an antiandrogen) provides modest to no benefit over castration alone in patients with metastatic disease. • Antiandrogen therapy should precede or be coadministered with LHRH agonist and be continued in combination for at least 7 days for patients with overt metastases who are at risk of developing symptoms associated with the flare in testosterone with initial LHRH agonist alone. • Antiandrogen monotherapy appears to be less effective than medical or surgical castration and is not recommended. • No clinical data support the use of finasteride or dutasteride with combined androgen blockade. • Patients who do not achieve adequate suppression of serum testosterone (less than 50 ng/dL) with medical or surgical castration can be considered for additional hormonal manipulations (with estrogen, antiandrogens, LHRH antagonists, or steroids), although the clinical benefit remains uncertain. Consider monitoring testosterone levels 12 weeks after first dose of LHRH therapy, then upon increase in PSA. The optimal level of serum testosterone to effect “castration” has yet to be determined. Monitor/Surveillance • ADT has a variety of adverse effects, including hot flashes, loss of libido, erectile dysfunction, shrinkage of penis and testicles, loss of muscle mass and strength, fatigue, anemia, breast enlargement and tenderness/soreness, depression and mood swings, hair loss, osteoporosis, greater incidence of clinical fractures, obesity, insulin resistance, alterations in lipids, and greater risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The intensity and spectrum of these side effects vary greatly, and many are reversible or can be avoided or mitigated. For example, physical activity can counter many of these symptoms and should be recommended (see NCCN Guidelines for Survivorship). Use of statins also should be considered. Patients and their medical providers should be advised about these risks prior to treatment. • Screening and treatment for osteoporosis are advised according to guidelines for the general population from the National Osteoporosis Foundation (www.nof.org). The National Osteoporosis Foundation guidelines include recommendations for: 1) calcium (1000–1200 mg daily from food and supplements) and vitamin D3 (400–1000 IU daily); and 2) additional treatment for men aged 50 years with low bone mass (T-score between -1.0 and -2.5, osteopenia) at the femoral neck, total hip, or lumbar spine by DEXA and a 10-year probability of hip fracture 3% or a 10-year probability of a major osteoporosis-related fracture 20%. Fracture risk can be assessed using FRAX®, the algorithm released by WHO. ADT should be considered “secondary osteoporosis” when using the FRAX® algorithm. Treatment options to increase bone density, a surrogate for fracture risk in men without metastases, include denosumab (60 mg SQ every 6 months), zoledronic acid (5 mg IV annually), and alendronate (70 mg PO weekly). • A baseline DEXA scan should be obtained before starting therapy in men at increased risk for fracture based on FRAX® screening. A follow-up DEXA scan after 1 year of therapy is recommended by the International Society for Clinical Densitometry, although there is no consensus on the optimal approach to monitoring the effectiveness of drug therapy. Use of biochemical markers of bone turnover to monitor response to therapy is not recommended. The serum level of 25-hydroxy vitamin D and average daily dietary intake of vitamin D will assist the nutritionist in making a patient-specific recommendation for vitamin D supplementation. There are currently no guidelines on how often to monitor vitamin D levels. However, for those who require monitoring with DEXA scans, it makes sense to check the serum vitamin D level at the same time. • Denosumab (60 mg SQ every 6 months), zoledronic acid (5 mg IV annually), and alendronate (70 mg PO weekly) increase bone mineral density, a surrogate for fracture risk, during ADT for prostate cancer. Treatment with either denosumab, zoledronic acid, or alendronate sodium is recommended when the absolute fracture risk warrants drug therapy. • Screening for and intervention to prevent/treat diabetes and cardiovascular disease are recommended in men receiving ADT. These medical conditions are common in older men and it remains uncertain whether strategies for screening, prevention, and treatment of diabetes and cardiovascular disease in men receiving ADT should differ from the general population. 1.10 "],["part-ii-geriatrics.html", "Part II - Geriatrics", " Part II - Geriatrics "],["part-iii-others.html", "Part III - Others", " Part III - Others "],["icd-10-cm.html", "2 ICD 10 CM 2.1 國際疾病分類第十版中英對照檢索", " 2 ICD 10 CM International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification 2.1 國際疾病分類第十版中英對照檢索 "],["tfda-atc.html", "3 TFDA ATC 3.1 藥品藥理治療分類 ATC Code", " 3 TFDA ATC Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification 3.1 藥品藥理治療分類 ATC Code "],["tfda-ahfsdi.html", "4 TFDA AHFS/DI 4.1 藥品藥理治療分類 AHFS/DI Code", " 4 TFDA AHFS/DI American Hospital Formulary Service / Drug Information 4.1 藥品藥理治療分類 AHFS/DI Code "],["frequently-used-links.html", "5 Frequently Used Links 5.1 醫藥參考 5.2 藥物辨識 5.3 Daily", " 5 Frequently Used Links 5.1 醫藥參考 UpToDate Cochrane考科藍 MedSci梅斯 OncoAssist 衛生福利部中央健康保險署：藥品給付規定內容-110.02.01 5.2 藥物辨識 衛生福利部食品藥物管理署：藥物辨識資料查詢 藥師公會全國聯合會：民眾用藥查詢 藥台灣 5.3 Daily 藥物血中濃度: HIS5 &gt; 藥局管理 &gt; 臨床管理 &gt; 藥物血中濃度監測評估清單 藥品交互作用: HIS5 &gt; 藥局管理 &gt; 臨床管理 &gt; 藥品交互作用評估工作清單 交接班清單: HIS5 &gt; 藥局管理 &gt; 臨床管理 &gt; 交接班清單 抗生素審核: HIS5 &gt; 藥局管理 &gt; 共用服務 &gt; 抗生素審核清單(藥師) "]]
