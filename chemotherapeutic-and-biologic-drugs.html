</ul></li>
<li>Mechanism_of_Action
<ul>
<li>Inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4 and 6.</li>
<li>Inhibition of CDK4 and CDK6 leads to inhibition of cell proliferation and growth by blocking progression of cells from G1 to the S-phase of the cell cycle.</li>
<li>Decreased expression of retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation (pRB) results in reduced E2F expression and signaling.</li>
<li>Induces cell senescence.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Mechanism_of_Resistance
<ul>
<li>Acquired CDK6 amplification resulting in increased CDK6 expression.</li>
<li>Increased expression of CDK2 and CDK4.</li>
<li>Loss of pRb expression.</li>
<li>Overexpression of cyclins A and E.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Absorption
<ul>
<li>Oral bioavailability is on the order of 46%. High-fat, high-calorie meal increases the AUC (area under the curve) of parent drug and its active metabolites by 9% and increases Cmax (maximum concentration) by 26%.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Distribution
<ul>
<li>Significant binding (96.3%) to plasma proteins, serum albumin, and alpha1-acid glycoprotein with extensive tissue distribution. Steady-state drug levels are achieved within 5 days following repeat daily dosing.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Metabolism
<ul>
<li>Extensively metabolized in the liver primarily by CYP3A4 microsomal enzymes, with formation of the major metabolite N-desethylabemaciclib (M2) and other additional metabolites, including M20, M18, and an oxidative metabolite (M1). These metabolites have similar biologic activity as the parent drug. Acylation and glucuronidation play only minor roles in drug metabolism. Nearly 81% of drug is recovered in feces and only 3% in urine, with the majority of eliminated drug being in metabolite form. The elimination half-life of the drug is 18.3 hours.</li>
</ul></li>

</ul></li>
<li>Mechanism_of_Action
<ul>
<li>Fluoropyrimidine carbamate prodrug form of 5-FU. Capecitabine itself is inactive.</li>
<li>Activation to cytotoxic forms is a complex process that involves three successive enzymatic steps. Metabolized in liver to 5’-deoxy-5-fluorocytidine (5’-DFCR) by the carboxylesterase enzyme and then to 5’-DFUR by cytidine deaminase (found in liver and in tumor tissues). Subsequently converted to 5-FU by the enzyme thymidine phosphorylase, which is expressed in higher levels in tumor versus normal tissue.</li>
<li>Inhibition of the target enzyme thymidylate synthase (TS) by the 5-FU metabolite FdUMP.</li>
<li>Incorporation of 5-FU metabolite FUTP into RNA, resulting in alterations in RNA processing and/or mRNA translation.</li>
<li>Incorporation of 5-FU metabolite FdUTP into DNA, resulting in inhibition of DNA synthesis and function.</li>
<li>Inhibition of TS leads to accumulation of dUMP and subsequent misincorporation of dUTP into DNA, resulting in inhibition of DNA synthesis and function.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Mechanism_of_Resistance
<ul>
<li>Increased expression of thymidylate synthase.</li>
<li>Decreased levels of reduced folate substrate 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate.</li>
<li>Decreased incorporation of 5-FU into RNA.</li>
<li>Decreased incorporation of 5-FU into DNA.</li>
<li>Increased activity of DNA repair enzymes, uracil glycosylase and dUTPase.</li>
<li>Decreased expression of mismatch repair enzymes (hMLH1, hMSH2).</li>
<li>Increased salvage of physiologic nucleosides, including thymidine.</li>
<li>Increased expression of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase.</li>
<li>Alterations in TS with decreased binding affinity of enzyme for FdUMP.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Absorption
<ul>
<li>Capecitabine is readily absorbed by the GI tract. Peak plasma levels are reached in 1.5 hours, while peak 5-FU levels are achieved at 2 hours after oral administration. The rate and extent of absorption are reduced by food.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Distribution
<ul>
<li>Plasma protein binding of capecitabine and its metabolites is less than 60%. Primarily bound to albumin (35%).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Metabolism
<ul>
<li>Capecitabine undergoes extensive enzymatic metabolism to 5-FU. After being absorbed as an intact molecule from the GI tract, it undergoes an initial hydrolysis reaction in the liver catalyzed by carboxylesterase to 5’-DFCR. In the next step, 5’-DFCR is converted in the liver and other tissues to 5’-DFUR by the enzyme cytidine deaminase. Finally, 5’-DFUR is converted to 5-FU by the enzyme thymidine phosphorylase in tumor tissue as well as in normal tissues expressing this enzyme. Selective accumulation of 5-FU within tumor tissue (colorectal) versus normal tissue (colon) (3.2 x) and plasma (21 x) has been demonstrated in a population of colorectal cancer patients requiring definitive surgical resection who received capecitabine preoperatively.</li>
<li>Catabolism accounts for &gt;85% of drug metabolism. Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) is the main enzyme responsible for the catabolism of 5-FU, and it is present in liver and extrahepatic tissues such as GI mucosa, WBCs, and the kidneys. Greater than 90% of an administered dose of drug and its metabolites is cleared in the urine. The major metabolite excreted in urine is alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine (FBAL). About 3% of the administered dose is excreted in urine as unchanged drug. The elimination half-life of capecitabine and capecitabine metabolites is on the order of 45-60 minutes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Indication
<ul>
<li>Metastatic breast cancer - FDA-approved when used in combination with docetaxel for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer after failure of prior anthracycline-containing chemotherapy.</li>
<li>Metastatic breast cancer - FDA-approved as monotherapy in patients refractory to both paclitaxel- and anthracycline-based chemotherapy or when anthracycline therapy is contraindicated.</li>
<li>Metastatic colorectal cancer - FDA-approved as first-line therapy when fluoropyrimidine therapy alone is preferred.</li>
<li>Stage III colon cancer - FDA-approved as adjuvant therapy when fluoropyrimidine therapy alone is preferred.</li>
<li>Clinical activity in gastric cancer, gastroesophageal cancer, and other GI cancers.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Dosage_Range
<ul>
<li>Recommended dose is 1,250 mg/m2 PO bid (morning and evening) for 2 weeks with 1 week rest. For combination therapy (capecitabine in combination with docetaxel) with docetaxel being dosed at 75 mg/m2 day 1 of a 21-day cycle.</li>
<li>May decrease dose of capecitabine to 850-1,000 mg/m2 bid on days 1-14 to reduce risk of toxicity without compromising efficacy (see section Special Considerations [8]).</li>
<li>An alternative dosing schedule for capecitabine monotherapy is 1,250-1,500 mg/m2 PO bid for 1 week on and 1 week off. This schedule appears to be well tolerated, with no compromise in clinical efficacy.</li>
<li>Capecitabine should be used at lower doses (850-1,000 mg/m2 bid on days 1-14) when used in combination with other cytotoxic agents, such as oxaliplatin.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Drug_Interaction
<ul>
<li>Capecitabine-warfarin interaction - Patients receiving concomitant capecitabine and oral coumarin-derivative anticoagulant therapy should have their coagulation parameters (PT and INR) monitored frequently in order to adjust the anticoagulant dose accordingly. A clinically important capecitabine-warfarin drug interaction has been documented. Altered coagulation parameters and/or bleeding, including death, have been reported in patients taking capecitabine concomitantly with coumarin-derivative anticoagulants such as warfarin. Post-marketing reports have shown clinically significant increases in PT and INR in patients who were stabilized on anticoagulants at the time capecitabine was introduced. These events occurred within several days and up to several months after initiating capecitabine therapy and, in a few cases, within 1 month after stopping capecitabine. These events occurred in patients with and without liver metastases. Age &gt;60 and a diagnosis of cancer independently predispose patients to an increased risk of coagulopathy.</li>
<li>Aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide - Concomitant use of aluminum hydroxide- or magnesium hydroxide-containing antacids may increase the bioavailability of capecitabine by 16%-35%.</li>
<li>Phenytoin - Capecitabine may increase phenytoin blood levels and subsequent phenytoin toxicity. Dose adjustment of phenytoin may be necessary.</li>
<li>Leucovorin - Leucovorin enhances the antitumor activity and toxicity of capecitabine.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Special_Consideration
<ul>
<li>Capecitabine should be taken with a glass of water within 30 minutes after a meal.</li>
<li>Contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to 5-FU.</li>
<li>Contraindicated in patients with known dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) deficiency.</li>
<li>No dose adjustments are necessary in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction. However, patients should be closely monitored.</li>
<li>In the setting of moderate renal dysfunction (baseline CrCl, 30-50 mL/min), a 25% dose reduction is recommended. Patients should be closely monitored, as they may be at greater risk for increased toxicity. Contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (CrCl &lt;30 mL/min).</li>
<li>Patients should be monitored for diarrhea and its associated sequelae, including dehydration, fluid imbalance, and infection. Elderly patients (&gt;80 years of age) are especially vulnerable to the GI toxicity of capecitabine. Moderate-to-severe diarrhea (&gt;grade 2) is an indication to interrupt therapy immediately. Subsequent doses should be reduced accordingly.</li>
<li>Drug therapy should be stopped immediately in the presence of grades 2 to 4 hyperbilirubinemia until complete resolution or a decrease in intensity to grade 1.</li>
<li>Drug therapy should be stopped immediately in the presence of grade 2 or higher adverse events until complete resolution or a decrease in intensity to grade 1. Treatment should continue at 75% of the initial starting dose for grade 2 or 3 toxicity. For grade 4 toxicities, if the physician chooses to continue treatment, treatment should continue at 50% of the initial starting dose.</li>
<li>Patients who experience unexpected, severe grade 3 or 4 myelosuppression, GI toxicity, and/or neurologic toxicity upon initiation of therapy may have an underlying deficiency in dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase. Therapy must be discontinued immediately, and further testing to identify the presence of this pharmacogenetic syndrome should be considered.</li>
<li>Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine, 50 mg PO bid) may be used to prevent and/or reduce the incidence and severity of hand-foot syndrome. Dose may be increased to 100 mg PO bid if symptoms do not resolve within 3-4 days.</li>
<li>Celecoxib at a dose of 200 mg PO bid may be effective in preventing and/or reducing the incidence and severity of hand-foot syndrome. A low-dose nicotine patch has also been found to be effective in this setting.</li>
<li>In patients with the hand-foot syndrome, the affected skin should be well hydrated using a bland and mild moisturizer. Instruct patients to soak affected hands and feet in cool to tepid water for 10 minutes, then apply petroleum jelly onto the wet skin. The use of lanolin-containing salves or ointments such as Bag Balm emollient may help.</li>
<li>Diltiazem can prevent capecitabine-induced coronary vasospasm and chest pain and may allow patients to continue to receive capecitabine.</li>
<li>Pregnancy category D. Breastfeeding should be avoided.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Toxicity
<ul>
<li>Diarrhea is dose-limiting, observed in up to 55% of patients. Similar to GI toxicity observed with continuous infusion 5-FU. Mucositis, loss of appetite, and dehydration also noted.</li>
<li>Hand-foot syndrome (palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia). Severe hand-foot syndrome is seen in 15%-20% of patients. Characterized by tingling, numbness, pain, erythema, dryness, rash, swelling, increased pigmentation, and/or pruritus of the hands and feet. Similar to dermatologic toxicity observed with continuous infusion 5-FU.</li>
<li>Nausea and vomiting occur in up to 50% of patients.</li>
<li>Elevations in serum bilirubin (20%-40%), alkaline phosphatase, and hepatic transaminases (SGOT, SGPT). Usually transient and clinically asymptomatic.</li>
<li>Myelosuppression is observed less frequently than with IV 5-FU. Leukopenia more common than thrombocytopenia.</li>
<li>Neurologic toxicity manifested by confusion, cerebellar ataxia, and rarely encephalopathy.</li>
<li>Cardiac symptoms of chest pain, ECG changes, and serum enzyme elevation. Rare event but increased risk in patients with prior history of ischemic heart disease.</li>
<li>Tear-duct stenosis, acute and chronic conjunctivitis.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Metabolism
<ul>
<li>Carboplatin does not undergo significant metabolism. As observed with cisplatin, carboplatin undergoes aquation reaction in the presence of low concentrations of chloride. This reaction is 100-fold slower with carboplatin when compared to cisplatin. Carboplatin is extensively cleared by the kidneys, with about 60% - 70% of drug excreted in urine within 24 hours. The elimination of carboplatin is slower than that of cisplatin, with a terminal half-life of 2 - 6 hours.</li>

<li>Ovarian cancer.</li>
<li>Germ cell tumors.</li>
<li>Head and neck cancer.</li>

<li>Bladder cancer.</li>
<li>Relapsed and refractory acute leukemia.</li>
<li>Endometrial cancer.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Dosage_Range
<ul>
<li>Dose of carboplatin is usually calculated to a target area under the curve (AUC) based on the glomerular filtration rate (GFR).</li>
<li>Calvert formula is used to calculate dose - Total dose (mg) = (target AUC) x (GFR + 25). Note: Dose is in mg NOT mg/m2.</li>
<li>Target AUC is usually between 5 and 7 mg/mL/min for previously untreated patients. In previously treated patients, lower AUCs (between 4 and 6 mg/mL/min) are recommended. AUCs &gt;7 are not associated with improved response rates.</li>
<li>Bone marrow/stem cell transplant setting - Doses up to 1600 mg/m2 divided over several days.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Drug_Interaction
<ul>
<li>Myelosuppressive agents - Increased risk of myelosuppression when carboplatin is combined with other myelosuppressive drugs.</li>
<li>Paclitaxel - Carboplatin should be administered after paclitaxel when carboplatin and paclitaxel are used in combination. This sequence prevents delayed paclitaxel excretion, which results in increased paclitaxel drug levels and potentially increased host toxicity.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Special_Consideration
<ul>
<li>Use with caution in patients with abnormal renal function. Dose reduction is required in the setting of renal dysfunction. Baseline CrCl must be obtained. Renal status must be closely monitored during therapy.</li>
<li>Although carboplatin is not as emetogenic as cisplatin, pretreatment with antiemetic agents is strongly recommended.</li>
<li>Avoid needles or IV administration sets containing aluminum because precipitation of drug may occur.</li>
<li>Contraindicated in patients with a history of severe allergic reactions to cisplatin, other platinum compounds, and mannitol.</li>
<li>In contrast to cisplatin, IV hydration pretreatment and post-treatment are not necessary. However, patients should still be instructed to maintain adequate oral hydration.</li>
<li>Hemodialysis clears carboplatin at 25% of the rate of renal clearance. Peritoneal dialysis is unable to remove carboplatin.</li>
<li>Risk of hypersensitivity reactions increases from 1% to 27% in patients receiving more than seven courses of carboplatin-based therapy. For such patients, a 0.02-mL intradermal injection of an undiluted aliquot of their planned carboplatin dose can be administered 1 hour before each cycle of carboplatin. This skin test identifies patients in whom carboplatin may be safely administered.</li>
<li>Pregnancy category D. Breastfeeding should be avoided.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Toxicity
<ul>
<li>Myelosuppression is significant and dose-limiting. Dose-dependent, cumulative toxicity is more severe in elderly patients. Thrombocytopenia is most commonly observed, with nadir by day 21.</li>
<li>Nausea and vomiting. Delayed nausea and vomiting can also occur, albeit rarely. Significantly less emetogenic than cisplatin.</li>
<li>Renal toxicity. Significantly less common than with cisplatin and rarely symptomatic.</li>
<li>Peripheral neuropathy is observed in less than 10% of patients. Patients older than 65 years and/or previously treated with cisplatin may be at higher risk for developing neurologic toxicity.</li>
<li>Mild and reversible elevation of liver enzymes, particularly alkaline phosphatase and SGOT.</li>
<li>Allergic reaction. Can occur within a few minutes of starting therapy. Presents mainly as skin rash, urticaria, and pruritus. Bronchospasm and hypotension are uncommon.</li>
<li>Alopecia is uncommon.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Distribution
<ul>
<li>Widely distributed to all tissues, with a 50-fold higher volume of distribution than cisplatin. About 40% of drug is sequestered in red blood cells within 2-5 hours of infusion. Extensively binds to plasma proteins in time-dependent manner (up to 98%).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Metabolism
<ul>
<li>Undergoes extensive non-enzymatic conversion to its active cytotoxic species. As observed with cisplatin, oxaliplatin undergoes aquation reaction in the presence of low concentrations of chloride. The major species are monochloro-DACH, dichloro-DACH, and mono-diaquo-DACH platinum. Renal excretion accounts for &gt;50% of oxaliplatin clearance. More than 20 different metabolites have been identified in the urine. Only 2% of drug is excreted in feces. Prolonged terminal half-life of up to 240 hours.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Indication
<ul>
<li>Metastatic colorectal cancer - FDA-approved in combination with infusional 5-FU/LV in patients with advanced, metastatic disease.</li>
<li>Early-stage colon cancer - FDA-approved as adjuvant therapy in combination with infusional 5-FU/LV in patients with stage III colon cancer and also effective in patients with high-risk stage II disease.</li>
<li>Metastatic pancreatic cancer.</li>
<li>Metastatic gastric cancer and gastroesophageal cancer.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Dosage_Range
<ul>
<li>Recommended dose is 85 mg/m2 IV over 2 hours, on an every-2-week schedule.</li>
<li>Can also be administered at 100-130 mg/m2 IV on an every-3-week schedule.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Drug_Interaction
<ul>
<li>None well characterized.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Special_Consideration
<ul>
<li>Use with caution in patients with abnormal renal function, especially when CrCl &lt;20 mL/min. Baseline creatinine clearance should be obtained, and renal status should be closely monitored during treatment.</li>
<li>Oxaliplatin should not be administered with basic solutions (e.g., solutions containing 5-FU), as it may be partially degraded.</li>
<li>Careful neurologic evaluation should be performed before starting therapy and at the beginning of each cycle, as the dose-limiting toxicity of oxaliplatin is neurotoxicity.</li>
<li>Caution patients to avoid exposure to cold following drug administration, which can trigger and/or worsen acute neurotoxicity.</li>
<li>Calcium/magnesium infusions (1 g calcium gluconate/1 g magnesium sulfate) prior to and at the completion of the oxaliplatin infusion can be used to reduce the incidence of acute neurotoxicity. There is no evidence that these infusions impair the clinical activity of oxaliplatin.</li>
<li>May lengthen oxaliplatin infusion from 2 to up to 4 hours to reduce the development of acute neurotoxicity.</li>
<li>Anaphylactic reactions to oxaliplatin have been reported and may occur within minutes of drug administration. This adverse event represents a black-box warning.</li>
<li>Pregnancy category D. Breastfeeding should be avoided.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Toxicity
<ul>
<li>Neurotoxicity with acute and chronic forms. Acute toxicity is seen in up to 80%-85% of patients and is characterized by a peripheral sensory neuropathy with distal paresthesia and visual and voice changes, often triggered or exacerbated by cold. Dysesthesias in the upper extremities and laryngopharyngeal region with episodes of difficulty breathing or swallowing can be observed and usually within hours or 1-3 days after therapy. Risk increases upon exposure to cold and usually is spontaneously reversible. Chronic toxicity is dose-dependent, with a 15% and &gt;50% risk of impairment in proprioception and neurosensory function at cumulative doses of 850 and 1,200 mg/m2, respectively. In contrast to cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity, oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy appears to be more readily reversible and returns to normal usually within 3-4 months of discontinuation of oxaliplatin. Gait abnormalities and cognitive dysfunction can also occur.</li>
<li>Nausea/vomiting. Occurs in the majority of patients treated with the combination of 5-FU/LV and oxaliplatin. Usually well-controlled with antiemetic therapy.</li>
<li>Diarrhea.</li>
<li>Myelosuppression. Relatively mild, with thrombocytopenia and anemia more common than neutropenia. Autoimmune thrombocytopenia, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and TTP have also been observed, albeit rarely.</li>
<li>Allergic reactions with facial flushing, rash, urticaria, and less frequently, bronchospasm and hypotension. In rare cases, anaphylactic-like reactions can occur.</li>
<li>Hepatotoxicity with sinusoidal injury resulting in portal hypertension, ascites, splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, and varices.</li>
<li>RPLS has been observed with headache, lethargy, seizures, visual disturbances, and encephalopathy.</li>
<li>Rare cases of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), acute ILD, and pulmonary fibrosis.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Mechanism_of_Action
<ul>
<li>Isolated from the bark of the Pacific yew tree, Taxus brevifolia.</li>
<li>Cell cycle-specific, active in the mitosis (M) phase of the cell cycle.</li>
<li>High-affinity binding to microtubules enhances tubulin polymerization. Normal dynamic process of microtubule network is inhibited, leading to inhibition of mitosis and cell division.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Mechanism_of_Resistance
<ul>
<li>Alterations in tubulin, with decreased binding affinity for drug.</li>
<li>Multidrug-resistant phenotype, with increased expression of P170 glycoprotein. Results in enhanced drug efflux, with decreased intracellular accumulation of drug. Cross-resistant to other natural products, including vinca alkaloids, anthracyclines, taxanes, and etoposide.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Absorption
<ul>
<li>Administered only via the IV route, as the drug is poorly soluble and not orally bioavailable.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Distribution
<ul>
<li>Distributes widely to all body tissues, including third-space fluid collections such as ascites. Negligible penetration into the CNS. Extensive binding (&gt;90%) to plasma and cellular proteins.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Metabolism
<ul>
<li>Metabolized extensively by the hepatic P450 microsomal system. About 70%-80% of drug is excreted via fecal elimination. Less than 10% is eliminated as the parent form, with the majority being eliminated as metabolites. Renal clearance is relatively minor, with less than 10% of drug cleared via the kidneys. Terminal elimination half-life ranges from 9 to 50 hours depending on the schedule of administration.</li>

<li>Ovarian cancer.</li>
<li>Breast cancer.</li>
<li>SCLC and NSCLC.</li>
<li>Head and neck cancer.</li>
<li>Esophageal cancer.</li>
<li>Prostate cancer.</li>

<li>Weekly schedule: 80-100 mg/m2 IV each week for 3 weeks with 1-week rest.</li>
<li>Infusional schedule: 140 mg/m2 as a 96-hour infusion.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Drug_Interaction
<ul>
<li>Radiation therapy - Paclitaxel is a radiosensitizing agent.</li>
<li>Concomitant use of inhibitors and/or activators of the liver P450 CYP3A4 enzyme system may affect paclitaxel metabolism and its subsequent antitumor and toxic effects.</li>
<li>Phenytoin, phenobarbital - Accelerate the metabolism of paclitaxel, resulting in lower plasma levels of drug.</li>
<li>Cisplatin, carboplatin - Myelosuppression is greater when platinum compound is administered before paclitaxel. Platinum compounds inhibit plasma clearance of paclitaxel. When a platinum analog is used in combination, paclitaxel must be given first.</li>
<li>Cyclophosphamide - Myelosuppression is greater when cyclophosphamide is administered before paclitaxel.</li>
<li>Doxorubicin - Paclitaxel reduces the plasma clearance of doxorubicin by about 30%, resulting in increased severity of myelosuppression.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Special_Consideration
<ul>
<li>Contraindicated in patients with history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to paclitaxel or to other drugs formulated in Cremophor EL, including cyclosporine, etoposide, or teniposide.</li>
<li>Use with caution in patients with abnormal liver function. Dose reduction is required in this setting. Patients with abnormal liver function are at significantly higher risk for toxicity. Contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic dysfunction.</li>
<li>Use with caution in patients with prior history of diabetes mellitus and chronic alcoholism or prior therapy with known neurotoxic agents such as cisplatin.</li>
<li>Use with caution in patients with previous history of ischemic heart disease, with MI within the preceding 6 months, conduction system abnormalities, or on medications known to alter cardiac conduction (beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and digoxin).</li>
<li>Patients should receive premedication to prevent the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions. Administer dexamethasone 20 mg PO at 12 and 6 hours before drug administration, diphenhydramine 50 mg IV, and cimetidine 300 mg IV at 30 minutes before drug administration. Patients experiencing major hypersensitivity reaction may be rechallenged after receiving multiple high doses of steroids, dexamethasone 20 mg IV every 6 hours for 4 doses. Patients should also be treated with diphenhydramine 50 mg IV and cimetidine 300 mg IV 30 minutes before the rechallenge.</li>
<li>Medical personnel should be readily available at the time of drug administration. Emergency equipment, including Ambu bag, ECG machine, IV fluids, pressors, and other drugs for resuscitation, must be at bedside before initiation of treatment.</li>
<li>Monitor patient’s vital signs every 15 minutes during the first hour of drug administration. Hypersensitivity reaction usually occurs within 2 - 3 minutes of start of infusion and almost always within the first 10 minutes.</li>
<li>Patients who have received &gt;6 courses of weekly paclitaxel should be advised to avoid sun exposure of their skin as well as their fingernails and toenails, as they are at increased risk for developing onycholysis. This side effect is not observed with the every-3-week schedule.</li>
<li>Pregnancy category D. Breastfeeding should be avoided.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Toxicity
<ul>
<li>Myelosuppression. Dose-limiting neutropenia with nadir at day 8-10 and recovery by day 15-21. Decreased incidence of neutropenia with 3-hour schedule when compared to 24-hour schedule.</li>
<li>Infusion reactions. Occurs in up to 20%-40% of patients. Characterized by generalized skin rash, flushing, erythema, hypotension, dyspnea, and/or bronchospasm. Usually occurs within the first 2-3 minutes of an infusion and almost always within the first 10 minutes. Incidence of hypersensitivity reaction is the same with 3- and 24-hour schedules. Premedication regimen, as outlined in Special Considerations, has significantly decreased incidence.</li>
<li>Neurotoxicity, mainly in the form of sensory neuropathy with numbness and paresthesias. Dose-dependent effect. Other risk factors include prior exposure to known neurotoxic agents (e.g., cisplatin) and pre-existing medical disorders such as diabetes mellitus and chronic alcoholism. More frequent with longer infusions and at doses &gt;175 mg/m2. Motor and autonomic neuropathy observed at high doses. Optic nerve disturbances with scintillating scotomata observed rarely.</li>
<li>Transient asymptomatic sinus bradycardia is most commonly observed cardiotoxicity. Occurs in 30% of patients. Other rhythm disturbances are seen, including Mobitz type I, Mobitz type II, and third-degree heart block, as well as ventricular arrhythmias.</li>
<li>Alopecia. Occurs in nearly all patients, with loss of total body hair.</li>
<li>Mucositis and/or diarrhea seen in 30%-40% of patients. Mucositis is more common with the 24-hour schedule. Mild-to-moderate nausea and vomiting, usually of brief duration.</li>
<li>Transient elevations in serum transaminases, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase.</li>
<li>Onycholysis. Mainly observed in patients receiving &gt;6 courses on the weekly schedule. Not usually seen with the every-3-week schedule.</li>
